Build Instructions for Gogreen 2.0
==================================
-First, download the Gogreen 2.0 community edition (CE): https://svn.onehippo.org/repos/closed/sandbox/rkauffman/gogreen-2.0/
-Build the Gogreen 2.0 CE using default build instructions: mvn clean install
-Next, download the Gogreen 2.0 enterprise edition (EE): https://svn.onehippo.org/repos/closed/sandbox/rkauffman/gogreen-enterprise-2.0/
-Build the Gogreen 2.0 EE using default build instructions: mvn clean install
-You can now run the project using: mvn -P cargo.run





OLD instructions:

Running locally
===============

Hippo GoGreen uses the Maven Cargo plugin to run the CMS and site locally in Tomcat.
From the project root folder, execute:

  $ mvn clean install
  $ mvn -P cargo.run

Access the CMS at http://localhost:8080/cms, and the site at http://localhost:8080/site
Logs are located in target/tomcat7x/logs

Building distribution
=====================

To build a Tomcat distribution tarball containing only deployable artifacts:

  $ mvn clean install
  $ mvn -P dist

See also src/main/assembly/distribution.xml

Creating the demo launcher
=======================

The demo launcher is an archive containing an executable jar that launches a Tomcat instance containing
the CMS and the Go Green site application.


To create demo launcher:
  $ mvn clean install
  $ cd dist
  $ mvn clean install -P dist-full,demo-launcher

This will create a .tar.gz and .zip archive containing the demo launcher under 'dist/target' directory

Using JRebel
============

Set the environment variable REBEL_HOME to the directory containing jrebel.jar.
Build with:

  $ mvn -Djrebel

or add -Djrebel to your MAVEN_OPTS environment variable:

  $ export MAVEN_OPTS="$MAVEN_OPTS -Djrebel"

Note: the latter *always* enables JRebel. To disable temporarily (e.g. when building/deploying a release) use

  $ mvn -P -jrebel

Do *not* activate JRebel using "mvn -P jrebel", as it then deactivates the "default" profile.

Hot deploy
==========

To hot deploy, redeploy or undeploy the CMS or site:

  $ cd cms (or site)
  $ mvn cargo:redeploy (or cargo:undeploy, or cargo:deploy)

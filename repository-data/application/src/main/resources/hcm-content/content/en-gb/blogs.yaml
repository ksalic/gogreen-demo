                              <p>During the recycling day, sponsored by Environment Ministry and Computer
                              Access New Zealand Trust, Dell New Zealand took in more than 30 tonnes of
                              obsolete equipment by 1,200 people at Wellington's Westpac Stadium. Instead of
                              the equipment going to a landfill where it is unable to decompose and will leak
                              chemicals into the ground, 97% of all equipment collected will be recycled.</p>

                              <p>Susan McGregor, an Auckland City Council spokesperson, said: "There is a
                              regional forum looking into waste disposal; but to date there is only a scheme
                              for hazardous material to be collected separately by the council. It [the
                              council] would welcome computer companies taking some responsibility for
                              disposing of old computer ware."</p>

                              <p>Dell has indicated it will hold another PC clean up next year.</p>

                              <p>According to Dell, out of the 6.3 million New Zealand computers, 250,000 of
                              them are old and obsolete, mainly because most computer owners, according to a
                              survey, will upgrade their computers every two to five years.</p>

                              <p>Sydney, Australia had recently hosted one of their own computer recycling
                              days; however Wellington's event was four times more successful.</p>

This simple looking round thermostat is reminiscent of old-school thermostats that one would manually adjust by turning the temperature dial. But the auto-awake feature that turns on the bright blue digital display when someone walks nearby gives the Nest away as an ultra-modern piece of high tech gadgetry.</p>
                              <p>The Nest&rsquo;s software &ldquo;learns&rdquo; the habits in a given space by logging when inhabitants tend to be home and awake and noting when they tend to turn up or down the heat&mdash;and then sets a heating/cooling schedule accordingly. Owners can also program the Nest, which connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi, to heat up or cool down the house at a set schedule or go into &ldquo;away&rdquo; mode from any web browser or smart phone.</p>
                              <p>While the Nest is likely the best known&nbsp;

                              <p>While only some of them have the auto-sensing and &ldquo;learning&rdquo; capabilities of the Nest, those without that feature also cost less. And merely programming in a weekly schedule to any smart thermostat will be the main source of cost and energy savings. People who were diligent about turning their old thermostats up and down throughout the day might not see any substantial savings with a smart thermostat, but most of us aren&rsquo;t so diligent&mdash;especially when it comes to turning the heat down at night when we are sleeping.</p>
                              <p>Many smart thermostat owners report savings of between $10 and $30 per month on their heating/cooling bills&mdash;and research has shown that such an upgrade can save upwards of 10 percent of the total energy consumed by a given household. Smart thermostats range in price from $50 to $250, so upgrading could pay for itself within a year or two at most, with long-term savings racking up month-by-month after that.</p>
                              <p>Many utilities now offer free or discounted smart thermostats to customers. Getting in on such a program is a great way to reduce energy costs without the up-front expense of installing a smart thermostat independently. According to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency (DSIRE), incentives to install smart thermostats are available through utilities in 45 states. New York&rsquo;s Con Edison, California&rsquo;s PG&amp;E and Texas&rsquo; CPS Energy are just a few of the larger utilities offering such incentives.</p>
                              <p>Those that do upgrade certainly won&rsquo;t be alone. Navigant Research reports that the number of smart thermostats in operation around the world will jump from 1.4 million currently installed to some 32 million by 2020. These kinds of numbers will help utilities meet or exceed energy efficiency goals regardless of other upgrades on the power plant side of their businesses. Likewise, the efficiency boost also can play a key role in reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and our emissions of greenhouse gases.</p>

            functioning thermostat with a new whiz-bang “smart” variety might seem
            like a waste of money, but it can be one of the best small investments

              <p>The coolest of the bunch of new smart thermostats, the&nbsp;
                              <a href="http://www.nest.com/" target="_blank" title="Nest Labs">Nest</a>, was created by former Apple employees who had been instrumental in designing the original iPod and iPhone years earlier. This simple looking round thermostat is reminiscent of old-school thermostats that one would manually adjust by turning the temperature dial. But the auto-awake feature that turns on the bright blue digital display when someone walks nearby gives the Nest away as an ultra-modern piece of high tech gadgetry.</p>
                              <p>The Nest&rsquo;s software &ldquo;learns&rdquo; the habits in a given space by logging when inhabitants tend to be home and awake and noting when they tend to turn up or down the heat&mdash;and then sets a heating/cooling schedule accordingly. Owners can also program the Nest, which connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi, to heat up or cool down the house at a set schedule or go into &ldquo;away&rdquo; mode from any web browser or smart phone.</p>
                              <p>While the Nest is likely the best known&nbsp;
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation" target="_blank" title="Home automation">smart thermostat</a>&nbsp;available&mdash;especially since Google acquired the company behind it in early 2014&mdash;several other manufacturers (including Honeywell, ecobee, Hunter, Radio Thermostat, Trane and Lux) have Wi-Fi-enabled smart thermostats available now as well.</p>
                              <p>While only some of them have the auto-sensing and &ldquo;learning&rdquo; capabilities of the Nest, those without that feature also cost less. And merely programming in a weekly schedule to any smart thermostat will be the main source of cost and energy savings. People who were diligent about turning their old thermostats up and down throughout the day might not see any substantial savings with a smart thermostat, but most of us aren&rsquo;t so diligent&mdash;especially when it comes to turning the heat down at night when we are sleeping.</p>
                              <p>Many smart thermostat owners report savings of between $10 and $30 per month on their heating/cooling bills&mdash;and research has shown that such an upgrade can save upwards of 10 percent of the total energy consumed by a given household. Smart thermostats range in price from $50 to $250, so upgrading could pay for itself within a year or two at most, with long-term savings racking up month-by-month after that.</p>
                              <p>Many utilities now offer free or discounted smart thermostats to customers. Getting in on such a program is a great way to reduce energy costs without the up-front expense of installing a smart thermostat independently.

              <p><strong>1. Keep it local</strong><br /> Many college students want an &quot;away from home&quot; experience. Just don&#39;t make it a &quot;shipping tons of stuff all over the country&quot; experience. If it&#39;s your first year at school, try to obtain your furnishings locally when you get to school (See tips 2 and 3). If you&#39;re a returning student, think about local storage &mdash; many schools offer storage options.</p>
                              <p><strong>2. Use the used</strong><br /> Sure, this may be your first home away from home, and we understand the urge to decorate with all the coolest new stuff from Target or WalMart. Just consider, for a second, how much waste that would mean, assuming most freshmen get relatively new stuff every year of school. See what we mean? Instead, why not check out great used sources of stuff, like local resale shops, Ebay Local, and Craigslist. You&#39;ll be guaranteed to have a really unique room d&eacute;cor (see tip 10 to max this out), and you&#39;ll have money left over to throw wild parties (Um, we mean library study snacks)</p>
                              <p><strong>3. Capture the free</strong><br /> Of course, while cheap used stuff is good, there is something better: Free used stuff. If you&#39;re a new freshman, check out Craigslist or Freecycle in your area to see if there are any items like beds, desks, or lamps that you can score for free. If you stayed at school over the summer for research or whatnot, your university may have a coordinated furniture recycling day. Or, you might just hang around during move-out and see what you can collect.</p>
                              <p><strong>4. Condition yourself, not your air</strong><br /> One of the most eco-friendly things you can do as a student is to give up air conditioning. Many universities make it really easy for you to do by banning AC units in dorms. But that doesn&#39;t stop some crafty students from sneaking them in. The trouble is, there are millions of students all over the world, which means the potential for hundreds of thousands of energy-sucking AC units. Instead of AC, why not try opening a window, turning on a fan, taking a cold shower before bed, or studying outside. Of course, if you have to have AC for allergies or some other reason, be sure to get an Energy-Star rated low-energy unit.</p>
                              <p><strong>5. Be sure your fridge is cool</strong><br /> Another big energy-sucker of dorms is the ol&#39; microfridge. Of course, the best thing you can do is go fridgeless or check into a shared larger fridge (many dorms have shared kitchens with fridges). But if you must have a fridge to yourself, make sure it&#39;s energy-star or other low-energy certified. This can save you 50% of the energy use of regular appliances.</p>
                              <p><strong>6. Cook it right</strong><br /> You may scoff at the microwave/toaster oven combo, but by combining these two cooking appliances with a cheap rice cooker, you&#39;ve got nearly the perfect eco-kitchen. All three of these appliances boast high energy efficiencies relative to their big-kitchen counterparts (see Getting Techie). Take a look at the end of this article for some great cookbooks using just these mini-cooker powerhouses.</p>
                              <p><strong>7. Paper please</strong><br /> Sure, it&#39;s not the most sexy of materials, but there are plenty of paper options for dorm d&Atilde;&copy;cor that can be recycled when you out-grow them in a few years. Check out paper wall tiles from MioCulture, paper window treatments from Redi Shade, or make your own paper lampshades. (links)</p>
                              <p><strong>8. See the light</strong><br /> Halogen torchiere lamps are all the rage right now. They&#39;re super cheap, put out tons of light, and fit in a corner with ease. Unfortunately, some of them use hundreds of watts of electricity, and they&#39;ve been known to cause fires. Stick with compact fluorescents. The newer ones put out great light, use just a trickle of electricity, and last almost forever. This is one thing worth buying again every time you move; by leaving them for your next tenant, you&#39;ll be spreading the green love with every new apartment.</p>
                              <p><strong>9. Don&#39;t let the sheets hit the fan</strong><br /> Linens for your new room will make up the bulk of the rest of your buying. When you look for sheets, curtains, or towels, go for organic cotton, if possible. It&#39;s still the same cottony goodness, but you&#39;ll rest easy knowing it&#39;s grown without nasty pesticides.</p>
                              <p><strong>10. Re-used doesn&#39;t have to mean re-pulsive</strong><br /> Just because you got used stuff, doesn&#39;t mean it has to be old and moldy. This is college. You&#39;re supposed to be wild and experimental. So go crazy. Why not try sewing some cushion covers, or pillows for that old couch. Or invite some of your new friends over for a painting party on that old dresser and table. Unleash your inner crafter with great magazines like Make, or Readymade, or sites like Craft, or Inventibles. (links here)</p>
                              <p><u><strong>So You Wanna Do More?&nbsp;</strong></u><br />
                              <strong>Get the word out</strong><br /> We recommended that you try to get used furniture for your room, but what if your school doesn&#39;t have a furniture-recycling program? Why not start one yourself. Stuff exchanges are a great way to meet the students around you, and score some new stuff for your old. Put up flyers around your dorm, and spread the word. Or, for a bigger splash, try talking to your head of student affairs or resident life. Furniture waste is a problem for universities too, so they&#39;ll probably jump at the chance to help.</p>
                              <p><u><strong>Getting Techie</strong>&nbsp;</u><br />
                              <strong>1. Why are microwaves and crockpots so good?</strong><br /> Cooking options like microwave ovens, toaster ovens, crock pots, and rice cookers concentrate the heat in the food, instead of heating so much extra air, or metal like conventional ovens and frying pans do. Electric grills are also heavy-duty energy users because they operate at such high temperatures (this also makes them fire hazards, and banned by many dorms). The lowest energy way to a meal is to think about what you need heated up, and what tool best to heat it with. Microwaves heat evenly throughout the food, especially if it is wet, like mashed potatoes, boiling water, or meat. Toaster ovens are really good at browning the surface of food (try cooking chicken or steak part way in a microwave and then browning in a toaster oven. It&#39;s super fast, and delicious.). Rice cookers are great for rice, or rice and frozen vegetables, and some of them come with attachments to steam veggies like broccoli at the same time. Crock pots are a whole other kind of cooking, but with practice, and a good cookbook, they can be the easiest and tastiest kind of food preparation, especially for a time-crunched student.</p>

Unleash your inner crafter with great magazines like Make, or Readymade, or sites like Craft, or Inventibles. (links here)</p>

                              <strong>Get the word out</strong><br /> We recommended that you try to get used furniture for your room, but what if your school doesn&#39;t have a furniture-recycling program? Why not start one yourself. Stuff exchanges are a great way to meet the students around you, and score some new stuff for your old. Put up flyers around your dorm, and spread the word. Or, for a bigger splash, try talking to your head of student affairs or resident life. Furniture waste is a problem for universities too, so they&#39;ll probably jump at the chance to help.</p>

                              <strong>1. Why are microwaves and crockpots so good?</strong><br /> Cooking options like microwave ovens, toaster ovens, crock pots, and rice cookers concentrate the heat in the food, instead of heating so much extra air, or metal like conventional ovens and frying pans do. Electric grills are also heavy-duty energy users because they operate at such high temperatures (this also makes them fire hazards, and banned by many dorms). The lowest energy way to a meal is to think about what you need heated up, and what tool best to heat it with. Microwaves heat evenly throughout the food, especially if it is wet, like mashed potatoes, boiling water, or meat. Toaster ovens are really good at browning the surface of food (try cooking chicken or steak part way in a microwave and then browning in a toaster oven. It&#39;s super fast, and delicious.). Rice cookers are great for rice, or rice and frozen vegetables, and some of them come with attachments to steam veggies like broccoli at the same time. Crock pots are a whole other kind of cooking, but with practice, and a good cookbook, they can be the easiest and tastiest kind of food preparation, especially for a time-crunched student.</p>

          hippogogreen:summary: Every year, intrepid young men and women set out for
            college. Even more exciting than this, is that for many of them, it's
            their first chance to live away from home. But, with the excitement and
            fun of furnishing a new dorm room comes a price. Every year, college students
            (and their parents) generate thousands of tons of garbage, because of
            the choices they make in buying furniture and accessories. Luckily, getting
            your dorm to be green has never been easier. All it takes is a little
            effort, a little creativity, and a few tips and tricks.

            hippostd:content: |-
              <p><strong>1. Keep it local</strong><br /> Many college students want an &quot;away from home&quot; experience. Just don&#39;t make it a &quot;shipping tons of stuff all over the country&quot; experience. If it&#39;s your first year at school, try to obtain your furnishings locally when you get to school (See tips 2 and 3). If you&#39;re a returning student, think about local storage &mdash; many schools offer storage options.</p>
                              <p><strong>2. Use the used</strong><br /> Sure, this may be your first home away from home, and we understand the urge to decorate with all the coolest new stuff from Target or WalMart. Just consider, for a second, how much waste that would mean, assuming most freshmen get relatively new stuff every year of school. See what we mean? Instead, why not check out great used sources of stuff, like local resale shops, Ebay Local, and Craigslist. You&#39;ll be guaranteed to have a really unique room d&eacute;cor (see tip 10 to max this out), and you&#39;ll have money left over to throw wild parties (Um, we mean library study snacks)</p>
                              <p><strong>3. Capture the free</strong><br /> Of course, while cheap used stuff is good, there is something better: Free used stuff. If you&#39;re a new freshman, check out Craigslist or Freecycle in your area to see if there are any items like beds, desks, or lamps that you can score for free. If you stayed at school over the summer for research or whatnot, your university may have a coordinated furniture recycling day. Or, you might just hang around during move-out and see what you can collect.</p>
                              <p><strong>4. Condition yourself, not your air</strong><br /> One of the most eco-friendly things you can do as a student is to give up air conditioning. Many universities make it really easy for you to do by banning AC units in dorms. But that doesn&#39;t stop some crafty students from sneaking them in. The trouble is, there are millions of students all over the world, which means the potential for hundreds of thousands of energy-sucking AC units. Instead of AC, why not try opening a window, turning on a fan, taking a cold shower before bed, or studying outside. Of course, if you have to have AC for allergies or some other reason, be sure to get an Energy-Star rated low-energy unit.</p>
                              <p><strong>5. Be sure your fridge is cool</strong><br /> Another big energy-sucker of dorms is the ol&#39; microfridge. Of course, the best thing you can do is go fridgeless or check into a shared larger fridge (many dorms have shared kitchens with fridges). But if you must have a fridge to yourself, make sure it&#39;s energy-star or other low-energy certified. This can save you 50% of the energy use of regular appliances.</p>
                              <p><strong>6. Cook it right</strong><br /> You may scoff at the microwave/toaster oven combo, but by combining these two cooking appliances with a cheap rice cooker, you&#39;ve got nearly the perfect eco-kitchen. All three of these appliances boast high energy efficiencies relative to their big-kitchen counterparts (see Getting Techie). Take a look at the end of this article for some great cookbooks using just these mini-cooker powerhouses.</p>
                              <p><strong>7. Paper please</strong><br /> Sure, it&#39;s not the most sexy of materials, but there are plenty of paper options for dorm d&Atilde;&copy;cor that can be recycled when you out-grow them in a few years.

            really ‘heated’ up, the thought that prods everyone’s mind is what ‘more’
            can be done to build an environment-friendly and sustainable society.
            On a personal level, people are trying their best to reduce the carbon-footprint
            by recycling various products and limiting the use of energy. On the other

            sustainability and do their bit for the environment.

            hippostd:content: "<p>Leading from the front on this mission are the Universities.\
              \ Education institutions are now taking a step forward in making a &lsquo;greener&rsquo;\
              \ society by practicing many new methods. Even students have become\
              \ more environment conscious and have started opting for sustainable\
              \ universities. So much so that getting a college degree from a reputed\
              \ university, which is also sustainable, has become the latest trend\
              \ in United Kingdom. For example, opting for Middlesex University MBA\
              \ course will ensure a business management degree from a university\
              \ that has jumped on a laudable 70th position (from 111th) on UK University\
              \ Green League table.</p> \n<p>These universities are trying their best\
              \ to recognize the rising environment demands and bringing newer methods\
              \ to practice sustainability.</p> \n<p><strong>Cycles and Electric Cars</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;\
              \ Universities have started bicycling schemes for transportation within\
              \ the campus. By the use of their I-cards, students can borrow bikes\
              \ without any charge and use it in the campus. At some universities,\
              \ students and staff members can also recharge their electric cars free\
              \ of charge.</p> \n<p><strong>Social Media</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; To\
              \ promote sustainability to their students, universities have turned\
              \ their focus to social media. Funny messages, forums, eye-catching\
              \ images encouraging &lsquo;going green&rsquo; are the methods used\
              \ by these institutions to make students aware of &lsquo;going green&rsquo;.</p>\
              \ \n<p><strong>Water re-usage</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Many campuses have\
              \ installed taps in the walls, making it easier to re-use and re-fill\
              \ water bottles. This cuts down bottled water waste and also the CO2\
              \ emissions caused by transporting them. There are also few universities\
              \ that have completely banned the selling of packaged water in their\
              \ campus.</p> \n<p><strong>Sustainable Building</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;\
              \ Some universities go to great lengths and actually design buildings\
              \ that are sustainable. Designing building that has natural light and\
              \ stay cool, use of green roofs, recycled building materials, etc. are\
              \ the initiatives taken by these institutions to build sustainable building.</p>\
              \ \n<p><strong>Disposal of Waste</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Similar to every\
              \ other organization, waste disposal is one grave crisis that universities\
              \ face. Few universities have found to deal with this problem wisely\
              \ by giving the wastes to a recycling company or sending it to a farm\
              \ to produce biogas and organic fertilizers.</p> \n<p>But taking these\
              \ steps won&rsquo;t be enough for Universities. Active engagement of\
              \ students and staff is imperative for lasting effects and long term\
              \ sustainability, which will surely ensure a green campus.</p>"

                              <p>Spectrolab produces multi-junction solar cells, originally designed for
                              powering satellites. The solar cells are three times more efficient than the
                              cells used in typical domestic solar panels, and are capable of converting light
                              energy to electrical energy with up to 34% efficiency according to NREL's
                              National Centre for Photovoltaics. Solar Systems utilise Spectrolab's
                              multi-junction solar cells to increase the output of their dish systems.</p>

                              <p>Solar Systems have already trialed the cells in one of their CS500
                              concentrating solar dishes installed at a solar power station in Hermannsburg,
                              Central Australia, established to reduce the consumption of diesel in the remote
                              community. Simply replacing the existing cells with the Spectrolab
                              multi-junction solar cells increased output from 24kW to 34kW.</p>

                              <p>Solar Systems is planning to use the technology in a solar power station it
                              will build in northern Victoria, with a capacity of 154MW.</p>

              <h2>1. Use electricity wisely.</h2>
                              <p>Turn off all computers, printers, photocopiers, and other equipment that doesn&rsquo;t need to be left on at the end of the day and leave them off until you need to use them again. Check that all computers/monitors are set to their most energy efficient settings (e.g., monitor set to shut off after 15 minutes of no use). When leaving a room for more than a few minutes, switch off the lights. Use compact fluorescent bulbs instead of incandescent ones. Take advantage of natural sunlight as much as possible.</p>
                              <h2>2. Reduce, reuse, recycle.</h2>
                              <p>&ldquo;Reduce, reuse, recycle&rdquo;&nbsp;means more than just throwing old notepaper in the blue bin (though you needn&rsquo;t stop doing that). Really think about everything you use. Do you need disposable cups at the water cooler? Can you use the other side of the used sheets of paper you&rsquo;ve thrown in the recycle bin? Australia has added a fourth R &ndash; Refuse. Simply put: Don&rsquo;t buy stuff you don&rsquo;t need. And, when you do make a purchase, bring your own bags.</p>
                              <h2>3. Use environmentally friendly office products.</h2>
                              <p>On average, they only cost 5% more, which is a small price to pay to cut down on waste and pollution. Start small &ndash; 100% recycled paper, refillable ink cartridges, non-toxic highlighters, etc. Check out
                              <a href="http://www.frogfile.com/" target="_blank">Frogfile</a>&nbsp;in Vancouver as a great place to stock up on office products that go easy on the environment.</p>
                              <h2>4. Use non-toxic cleaning products.</h2>
                              <p>There are many brands available nowadays, such as&nbsp;
                              <a href="http://www.naturecleanliving.com/" target="_blank">Nature Clean</a>,
                              <a href="https://www.norwex.com/" target="_blank">Norwex</a>,&nbsp;

                              <a href="http://www.tkoorange.com/" target="_blank">Orange TKO</a>, and&nbsp;
                              <a href="http://pinksolution.ca/" target="_blank">Pink Solution</a>. Encourage your cleaning company to use green cleaning products and if they won&rsquo;t, switch to one of the many companies that now do use environmentally friendly products. Case study: Novex Delivery Solutions switched to a green cleaning company when their previous supplier refused and they ended up saving money!</p>
                              <h2>5. Make eco-friendly food choices.</h2>
                              <p>Encourage use of the 100-mile diet: local first; organic for high consumption foods. When ordering lunch for an office meeting, how about going vegetarian (or even vegan, if you dare)? Cutting down on meat can have a huge impact on the health of the planet. (See&nbsp;

                              <h2>6. Telecommuting</h2>
                              <p>Encourage working from home, particularly for workers who would normally drive to work. This cuts down on pollution and increases time availability.</p>
                              <h2>7. Transportation</h2>
                              <p>For those who do come to the office on a regular basis, encourage (and help arrange) carpooling, use of public transit, biking, or walking.</p>
                              <h2>8. Aim for a paperless office.</h2>
                              <p>Though the paperless office may still seem unrealistic, at least try to cut down on printed material when possible.&nbsp;Read on-screen and only print documents when absolutely necessary. Use only 100% recycled content paper products in the office and when getting promotional material professionally produced, ask your printer for&nbsp;
                              <a href="http://www.fsc.org/" target="_blank">FSC Certified</a>&nbsp;paper.</p>
                              <h2>9. Institute a casual dress code.</h2>
                              <p>Not having to wear suits in hot summer months can help keep cooling costs down (and make for a happier workplace).</p>
                              <h2>10. Fair trade &amp; organic.</h2>
                              <p>Buy fair trade, organic coffee and teas&nbsp;for the office. If employees prefer to go out for their hot beverages, encourage them to take their own mugs. Most coffee shops offer a small discount to patrons who do so. More importantly is the reduction in waste from not having to throw out paper or Styrofoam cups.</p>

                              <p>For those who do come to the office on a regular basis, encourage (and help arrange) carpooling, use of public transit, biking, or walking.</p>
                              <h2>8. Aim for a paperless office.</h2>
                              <p>Though the paperless office may still seem unrealistic, at least try to cut down on printed material when possible.&nbsp;Read on-screen and only print documents when absolutely necessary. Use only 100% recycled content paper products in the office and when getting promotional material professionally produced, ask your printer for&nbsp;
                              <a href="http://www.fsc.org/" target="_blank">FSC Certified</a>&nbsp;paper.</p>
                              <h2>9. Institute a casual dress code.</h2>
                              <p>Not having to wear suits in hot summer months can help keep cooling costs down (and make for a happier workplace).</p>
                              <h2>10. Fair trade &amp; organic.</h2>
                              <p>Buy fair trade, organic coffee and teas&nbsp;for the office. If employees prefer to go out for their hot beverages, encourage them to take their own mugs. Most coffee shops offer a small discount to patrons who do so. More importantly is the reduction in waste from not having to throw out paper or Styrofoam cups.</p>

                              <p>No, Toyota isn't trying to con you into buying a
                              "<a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/water-powered-car-true-believers-question.php">water
                              powered car</a>". They are simply trying to illustrate a simple point about
                              <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/04/ford-fusion-hybrid-challenge-81-mpg-1445-miles-one-tank.php">fuel-efficient
                              driving</a> that, sadly, too few people seem to know: If you drive smoothly and
                              try to avoid abrupt acceleration and deceleration as much as possible, you'll
                              save fuel. It's sound advice (of course, use your judgement and don't put saving
                              fuel above driving safely and sanely), and a good way to get a "feel" for that
                              kind of driving is to <em>imagine</em> that there's a glass of water on your
                              dash (or use Toyota's
                              <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/a-glass-of-water/id376721035">virtual
                              water glass iPhone app</a>) or an egg between the gas pedal and your foot
                              (sorry, no app for that). Even better if you have a fuel economy gauge that
                              shows you real time consumption. This doesn't mean you should drive slowly in
                              traffic, but when appropriate, you can save a lot of gas (and CO2) by being a
                              smooth operator.</p>

              <html> <body> <h3>Add a Sprinkling of
                              Zinc and Copper Dust... </h3> <p>Researchers have found that
                              adding some nano-particles to water can improve its thermal conductivity (its ability to
                              move heat) by around 60%, a huge improvement! This would have many benefits, including
                              the ability to pack even more servers in a data-center because more heat could be
                              removed using the same water-cooling system. How does it work? Read
                              on.</p> <h3>How it Works </h3>
                              <p>The first problem that had to be solved was finding a way to keep
                              whatever nano-particles you add to the water from sticking together and becoming, well,
                              not nano anymore. This challenge was met by adding emulsifying agents that keep
                              everything separate as much as possible.</p> <p>The goal is
                              then to figure out which elements are best as improving the conductivity of the water,
                              and how much of them you need to have an optimal mix. So far the favorites are oxides of
                              metals like zinc and copper, but carbon nanotubes (which are extremely versatile) are
                              also being considered.</p> <p>It is not simply a matter of
                              the added ingredient (6-8% of the total volume seems to be the optimum mix) being a good
                              conductor in its own right, though this helps. Nanofluids are better conductors than the
                              sum of their parts. That suggests the particles are changing the structure of the water
                              itself in ways that improve its conductivity. Water, despite its protean appearance, has
                              a lot of internal structure, particularly when it is cool. The molecules are organised,
                              albeit more loosely, in ways that resemble the material's solid form, ice. Nanoparticles
                              inevitably alter this arrangement, and that may make the mix better able to transmit
                              heat. </p> </body> </html>

          hippogogreen:summary: Cooling things (buildings, power plants, data centers,
            etc) takes a lot of energy. There are different ways to go about it, but
            when you need a lot of cooling, water-cooling is hard to beat. And it
            might just be about to get even better!

              <html> <body> <h3>Add a Sprinkling of
                              Zinc and Copper Dust... </h3> <p>Researchers have found that
                              adding some nano-particles to water can improve its thermal conductivity (its ability to
                              move heat) by around 60%, a huge improvement! This would have many benefits, including
                              the ability to pack even more servers in a data-center because more heat could be
                              removed using the same water-cooling system. How does it work? Read
                              on.</p> <h3>How it Works </h3>
                              <p>The first problem that had to be solved was finding a way to keep
                              whatever nano-particles you add to the water from sticking together and becoming, well,
                              not nano anymore. This challenge was met by adding emulsifying agents that keep
                              everything separate as much as possible.</p> <p>The goal is
                              then to figure out which elements are best as improving the conductivity of the water,
                              and how much of them you need to have an optimal mix. So far the favorites are oxides of
                              metals like zinc and copper, but carbon nanotubes (which are extremely versatile) are
                              also being considered.</p> <p>It is not simply a matter of
                              the added ingredient (6-8% of the total volume seems to be the optimum mix) being a good
                              conductor in its own right, though this helps. Nanofluids are better conductors than the
                              sum of their parts. That suggests the particles are changing the structure of the water
                              itself in ways that improve its conductivity. Water, despite its protean appearance, has
                              a lot of internal structure, particularly when it is cool. The molecules are organised,
                              albeit more loosely, in ways that resemble the material's solid form, ice. Nanoparticles
                              inevitably alter this arrangement, and that may make the mix better able to transmit
                              heat. </p> </body> </html>

              <html> <body> <p>Armed with nearly 970
                              thousand square feet of 4 millimeter thick thermal material, workers scramble to cover
                              the highly threatened Presena glacier to protect it from the sun's ultraviolet rays.
                              With any luck, the insulating material reduce the amount of ice that melts from the
                              summer heat until it's removed at the end of the season.</p>
                              <p>This isn't the first time Italy has used this material to help preserve
                              its glaciers. Two years back, a smaller-scale test was made and the results showed it to
                              be quite effective. Ice covered by the insulating material melted 60 percent less than
                              exposed portions which lost an average of 5 feet in thickness during the
                              test.</p> <p>The creative plan couldn't come at a better
                              time for the glaciers in Italy's Province of Trento, which, like many of the world's
                              glaciers, has seen dramatic decreases in recent decades. According to BBC Brasil,
                              between 1993 and 2003 alone, Trento's Presena glacier lost as much as 39 percent of its
                              total mass. </p> <p>And the culprit? You guessed
                              it.</p> <p>"One thing is certain: the melting of glaciers
                              occurs because of the increase in global temperature," Nicola Paoli, an environmental
                              engineer, tells BBC Brasil. "In the last four, five years , we observed that the melting
                              snow has doubled compared to normal rhythm."</p>
                              <p>Unfortunately, no matter how ambitious or creative such local efforts
                              may be in regions of the world most effected by rising temperatures, it is a global
                              problem that will take an international effort to mitigate. So despite all the hard work
                              to save the Presena glacier, it may be only delaying the inevitable. </p>

                              <body>

                              <p>In May 2010, Akio Toyoda and Elon Musk, leaders of Toyota and Tesla,
                              respectively, announced they would work together on electric vehicles. The
                              agreement formalizes this announcement and would allow Tesla to work with Toyota
                              at an automobile production plant in California.</p>

                              <p>The plant will open 2011, when Tesla reopens it after it bought the Fremont,
                              California plant. The plant was previously used by Toyota and General Motors,
                              but was shut down when Toyota said it would not produce cars in California.</p>

                              <p>Tesla currently produces only a single model, the US$109,000 Roadster,
                              although it is currently designing a second model, the Model S, which will be
                              produced at the Fremont factory.</p>

                              <p>Analysts supported the move; John Boesel, CEO of a green-transportation trade
                              group, said that "Toyota's willingness to partner with Tesla to provide an
                              electric version of one of the Japanese automaker's existing vehicles suggests
                              the partnership between the two companies is going to be a meaningful one."</p>

                              <p>Following this announcement, Tesla's shares rose $0.75, while Toyota's fell
                              $1.65.</p>

              \ is conducive to positive work by increasing a person&#39;s ability\

              \ Dr Andrew Smith, Lecturer in Facilities Management at the University\
              \ of Central Lancashire, have shown that plants not only raised the\
              \ humidity levels to make space more comfortable but also reduced other\
              \ toxins within the environment and appeared to help increase productivity.&nbsp;</li>\
              \ \n<li>An added bonus was that short term sick leave was reduced by\
              \ 50% in a planted room whilst an unplanted room increased slightly&nbsp;</li>\
              \ </ul> \n<p>In addition to greening your office to promote a healthier\
              \ work place other simple steps include:</p> \n<ul> \n<li>Open your\
              \ windows to increase air flow. &nbsp;If you can&#39;t open windows,\
              \ take some short fresh air breaks outside</li> \n<li>Use non-toxic\
              \ cleaning products, damp cloths are sufficient to clean most dusty\
              \ workspaces</li> \n<li>Don&#39;t use aerosols they can contain damaging\
              \ propellants &ndash; opt for liquids and spray products instead</li>\
              \ \n<li>Lift Free Day &ndash; persuade management to stop the lifts\
              \ for one day to promote taking the stairs</li> </ul> \n<h2>Friday -\
              \ Keep going</h2> \n<ul> \n<li>Get Networking &ndash; why not spread\
              \ your success a little further: issue a press release and image on\
              \ behalf of your company and let the wider business environment know\
              \ of your success</li> \n<li>Set a target of incorporating three environmentally\
              \ friendly social media posts and tweets on your company pages each\
              \ week. Why not use&nbsp;#greenoffice14</li> \n<li>Thank your colleagues\
              \ for their support and aim to set up a green ideas scheme which encourages\
              \ and rewards lean, green thinking in your company</li> \n<li>Check\

              <html>
                              <body>

                              <p>2013 is the United Nations' International Year of Deserts and
                              Desertification. Yet deserts could become the "carbon-free power houses of the
                              21st century," some experts believe. They argue an area 800 by 800 km of desert,
                              such as the Sahara, could capture the solar energy to generate all the world's
                              electricity needs - and more.</p>

                              <p>The report, prepared by experts from across the globe, flags options that may
                              help governments and relevant bodies deliver a more sustainable future for the
                              Earth's desert regions.</p>

                              <p>"There are many popular and sometimes misplaced views of deserts which this
                              report either confirms or overturns. Far from being barren wastelands, they
                              emerge as biologically, economically and culturally dynamic while being
                              increasingly subject to the impacts and pressures of the modern world," said
                              Shafqat Kakakhel, UNEP's Officer in Charge and Deputy Executive Director.</p>

                              <p>"If the huge, solar-power potential of deserts can be economically harnessed
                              the world has a future free from fossil fuels. And tourism based around desert
                              nature can, if sensitively managed, deliver new prospects and perspectives for
                              people in some of the poorest parts of the world," said Mr Kakakhel.</p>

                              <p>Almost one-quarter of the earth's land surface – some 33.7 million square
                              kilometres – has been defined as "desert" in some sense. These deserts are
                              inhabited by over 500 million people, significantly more than previously
                              thought. In many parts of the world desert cores remain pristine, representing
                              some of the planet's "last remaining areas of total wilderness," stated the UNEP
                              in a news release.</p>

                              <p>Desert species are on the brink of extinction the Global Deserts Outlook
                              reports. At risk animals include various species of Gazelle, Oryx, Addax,
                              Arabian Tahr and the Barbary sheep as well as one of the falconers favourite
                              prey, the Houbara. "At greatest risk are the few patches of dry woodlands
                              associated with desert mountain habitats which may decline by up to 3.5 per cent
                              per year," said the study.</p>

                              <p>As a result of their valuable water supplies being diverted to domestic or
                              agricultural use, desert wetlands, fed by the large rivers crossing deserts, are
                              probably the most threatened ecosystem. Probable impacts include those created
                              by roads, settlement expansion and other infrastructure developments around
                              areas of desert montane. By 2050 the report estimates that desert wilderness -
                              those areas where there are no nearby roads - will decline from just under 60
                              per cent of the current total desert area to just over 30 per cent.</p>

                              <p>The pharmaceutical potential of desert plants has yet to be tapped, suggests
                              the report. Scientists across the globe are analysing many desert plants for
                              potential medicinal compounds - including anti-cancer and anti-malarial
                              substances, antioxidants, as well as appetite suppressants.</p>

                              <p><strong>Impact of climate change</strong></p>

                              <p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who advise governments
                              and the United Nations, have reported that temperatures in deserts could rise by
                              an average of as much as five to seven degrees by 2100. The problem, UNEP say,
                              will almost certainly be compounded by the melting of glaciers - whose waters
                              sustain many deserts.</p>

                              <p>The impacts of climate change include the transformation of semi-arid
                              rangelands into deserts, UNEP reports. They say water supplies are under threat
                              from salinization and pollution by pesticides and herbicides, and that rising
                              water tables beneath irrigated soils has led to more salinization of soils.</p>

                              <p>In some coastal areas ground-water supplies have been contaminated as
                              seawater invades subsurface waters, the report shows. Large rivers that run
                              through deserts have supported desert people for millennia, but many have been
                              dammed, with water loss downstream having led to serious impacts on flood plains
                              and river ecology.</p>

                              running for two-weeks from December 7 until December 18. Around 15,000 delegates
                              including representatives from the private sector, environmental organizations,
                              research institutions and government officials, as well as 110 heads of state
                              and government from 192 countries, will attend.</p>

                              <p>The <em>COP15 Cultural Opening Ceremony</em> played a four-minute long film
                              called <em>Please help the world</em> by the Danish director Mikkel Blaabjerg
                              Poulsen to highlight the danger of rising temperatures. The film depicts a young
                              girl’s screaming nightmare about an eco-apocalypse with global warming, desert
                              wastelands and terrifying floods. As the girl wakes from the nightmare she and
                              other children implores us to 'Please help the world'. Poulsen said, “We have
                              made a film which speaks to the heart rather than to the brain”. There was also
                              music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the Danish National Girls Choir.</p>

                              <p>The UN climate change conference, the climax of two years of contentious
                              negotiations, opened in an atmosphere of hope. There was an upbeat mood for a
                              deal to be reached within the next two weeks. At a press briefing,
                              <a title="w:Connie Hedegaard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Hedegaard">Connie
                              Hedegaard</a>, the president of the conference, said that “the deadline is
                              working”, but “within the time we have, we must solve the task”.
                              <a title="w:Lars Lokke Rasmussen" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Lokke_Rasmussen">Lars
                              Lokke Rasmussen</a> stressed, however, that the talks will have to overcome the
                              deep distrust between rich and poor nations on how to share the burden of
                              curbing emissions. There has been a series of promises by rich and emerging
                              economies to curb their greenhouse gases, but there are major issues yet to be
                              resolved. UN Secretary-General
                              <a title="w:Ban Ki-moon" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon">Ban
                              Ki-moon</a> said that a legally binding treaty on climate change will be reached
                              in 2010.</p>

                              <p>The
                              <a title="w:European Union" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union">European
                              Union</a> has adopted a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20
                              percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels but the union will raise its commitments
                              to 30% if other major players undertake “comparable commitments”. News that the

                              States Environmental Protection Agency</a> ruled that greenhouse gases endanger
                              human health may allow reductions of

                              greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Quoting an unnamed diplomatic source, the
                              Financial Times Deutschland has said the EU is to provide “1-3 billion euro” in
                              aid to developing countries over the next three years so they can fight the
                              effects of climate change and allow climate change mitigation and adaptation.

                              <p>The conference was accused of environmental hypocrisy for its substantial
                              carbon footprint, including its extensive use of private jets and limousines. To
                              reduce the conference's environmental and climate impact, the Danish government
                              will not give gifts to participants. The money will be spent on climate
                              scholarships called <em>COP15 Climate Scholarships</em>, allowing 10-12
                              candidates to carry out 2-year climate related master’s programmes at Danish
                              universities. Thousands of people are outside the conference building including
                              groups such as Climate Justice Action,

                              and

                              calling for urgent action. The environmental group Friends of the Earth
                              condemned what it called “undemocratic practices adopted by the Danish
                              presidency of convening small and exclusive groups of countries before the
                              Copenhagen meeting”. A draft negotiating text has been publicly released, but it
                              is rumored that there is an “alternate” treaty document being developed by some
                              large countries in the negotiations, including conference organizers.</p>

                              <p>According to the

                              countries have announced that they will come to Copenhagen before the 18th of
                              December in an attempt to seal a political global climate deal. If a deal is
                              reached, the UN will aim at transforming it into a legally binding text to
                              replace the
                              <a title="w:Kyoto Protocol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto

                              resolved. UN Secretary-General

                              carbon footprint, including its extensive use of private jets and limousines. To
                              reduce the conference's environmental and climate impact, the Danish government
                              will not give gifts to participants. The money will be spent on climate

          hippogogreen:summary: NASA has completed a major test of a 20-meter square
            solar sail, marking a "crucial milestone" in space propulsion technology.
            It is not the first to test solar sails, as the Japanese have deployed
            two solar sails in space. The Planetary Society is planning on launching
            a solar sail possibly by June 21.

                              <p>Shot into orbit by a converted intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the
                              Cosmos 1 would be launched from a submerged Russian submarine from within the
                              Barents Sea. The spacecraft, powered by the sail, will have no destination. The
                              purpose is simply to test the propulsion system that uses the pressure from
                              solar light particles to move the ship outward from a starting orbit around the
                              earth at 500 miles.</p>

                              <p>The propulsion technology is currently believed to be the most efficient
                              available for interstellar space travel. Theoretically a craft propelled by the
                              pressure of a constant light source, such as a purpose-built laser, could
                              achieve speeds approaching the speed of light. This is due to the efficiencies
                              of the spacecraft not having to carry its own fuel. Approaching the speed of
                              light would, however, require a long period of constant acceleration. Such high
                              speed will be impossible for the current test vehicles and any launched in the
                              foreseeable future, as they rely on the light from the Sun, which rapidly
                              becomes weaker with increasing distance.</p>

                              <p>According to the National Geographic News, "NASA, the European Space Agency,
                              Japan, and Russia all have developed solar sails, but none has yet tried to
                              prove that the sails can propel a spacecraft under controlled flight."</p>

                              warming</a>. The team of researchers report that the actual warming due to human
                              fossil fuel emissions could be 15 percent to 78 percent higher than estimates
                              that fail to take into account the feedback mechanism which involves carbon
                              dioxide and Earth temperature.</p>

                              atmosphere. As greenhouse gas levels rose, so did the Earth's temperature," the
                              scientists reported.</p>

                              <p>Dr Margaret Torn of
                              <a title="w:Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Berkeley_National_Laboratory">Lawrence
                              Berkeley National Laboratory</a> said: "It means the warming is happening
                              faster, each decade is actually warming faster than it would have," Dr Torn
                              said. "It's the pace of change that will be one of the big problems. It's how
                              humans adapt and the cost that will depend on the rate of change of climate."
                              </p>

                              <p>Over the past 30 years, the Earth has warmed by 0.6 degrees Celsius,
                              <a title="w:NASA" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</a> has
                              reported. Over the past 100 years, it has warmed by 0.8 degrees C, indicating a
                              recent acceleration in warmth. Current climate models predict temperature
                              increases of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius, but the California team realised that
                              additional carbon dioxide caused by the natural solar cycle may elevate these
                              estimates.</p>

                              <p>Taking this information on board could mean temperature increases of 1.6 to 6
                              degrees Celsius - and the higher temperatures are more likely, they said in a
                              statement.</p>

                              <p>Meanwhile, another group of leading US scientists has linked global warming
                              to the recent increase in hurricane intensity. They warn that humans must
                              develop cleaner energy and transportation immediately - or bear the risk of more
                              extreme storms.</p>

                              <p>"One is faced with repeating history, of putting up with $200 billion worth
                              of damage every so often," said Dr. Peter Webster, a professor at the
                              <a title="w:Georgia Institute of Technology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Institute_of_Technology">Georgia
                              Institute of Technology</a> and author of a 2005 study that found the strength
                              and duration of hurricanes has doubled in the last 50 years. "I’m not sure how
                              many $200 billion the country can afford," he told journalists.</p>

                              <p>Lawrence Berkeley's Dr Torn said humans are the biggest unknown: "To predict
                              the future, you have to guess how much CO2 levels will go up. That depends on
                              the biggest uncertainty of all - what humans decide to do. Do we get smart and
                              prevent CO2 emissions? Do we continue with business as usual? Or will we end up
                              somewhere in between?"</p>

                              Winter Time and Summer Time in the same day with the states of European Union
                              and other countries part of this deal. Official Winter Time is adopted in the
                              last Sunday of October and the Summer Time in last Sunday of March.</p>

                              <p>Usually, the official time of a country is Winter Time. Summer Time is a
                              legal time adopted by some countries or territories during a part of a year.
                              Summer Time is usually one hour in front of Standard Official Time.</p>

                              <p>This system is used for daylight-saving. During summer months, the time is
                              moved forward in order to use as much sunlight for human activities, as well as
                              to save electric energy used for lighting.</p>

                              <p>In Romania, Summer Time was first introduced in 1932. Until 1939 this worked
                              yearly from the first Sunday of April (in 1932: 22 May) 00:00 AM and the first
                              Sunday of October 01:00 AM (local time). From 1 April 1940 00:00 AM and 2
                              November 1942 03:00 AM, Summer Time was permanent in Romania. From 1943 the
                              Summer Time was suspended and Romania used just Official Time (Winter Time).</p>

                              <p>Summer Time was reintroduced from 1979 and guided by two rules until the

                              <p>Bill Gates, Founder of Microsoft, announced last week that his venture group
                              (Cascade Investments) initiated the purchase of 25.5% ownership in Pacific
                              Ethanol Inc. Pacific Ethanol is an ethanol production company that plans to
                              expand operations by opening a new facility in California. Gates is not alone in
                              high profile investments into the clean energy market, Bob Metcalfe (Founder of
                              3COM and Inventor of Ethernet), who acts as the managing partner of Polaris
                              Ventures, announced the VC's first investment into the energy market. Polaris,
                              which manages over $3 Billion in funds, invested $6.8 million into GreenFuel
                              Technologies Corporation of Cambridge, MA. GreenFuel Technologies is an
                              emissions to biofuels company, that utilizes natural algae in their patented
                              bioreactors to turn greenhouse gas emissions from power plants into rich bio
                              fuel. Polaris's investment into GreenFuel was part of the company's $18 Million
                              Series B financing round that also included a high profile venture capital
                              investor: Draper Fisher Jurvetson. When asked about the new industry venture,
                              Bob Metcalfe said, "Energy has got to be one of the top five problems the world
                              faces, and it's been frustrating to watch activists and politicians fail to
                              solve the problem,...Now it's time for the entrepreneurs and scientists to give
                              it a try."</p>

                              <p>According to the International Energy Association, demand for renewable
                              energy fuels will more than quadruple in the next decade. The current jump in
                              oil prices is fueling investment into this relatively new market as investors
                              view clean technology as an emerging opportunity rather than a public relations
                              campaign. As gasoline prices continue to rise, alternative fuels become
                              respectively cheaper and more attractive. In his latest State of the Union
                              Address, President Bush outlined a plan to direct new investment into ethanol
                              production and other clean technologies. According to a poll conducted by CBS
                              News, Americans now see gas prices as one of their top three main concerns. With
                              pressure coming from constituents, politicians are beginning to exert pressure
                              on new spending on renewable technology to promote energy independence. Yet
                              another front in this debate is that of environmental concern. With global
                              warming on the rise, and many European governments eagerly searching for a
                              Carbon Dioxide solution, the promise of reducing these emissions by 46% (as
                              claimed by GreenFuel's bio reactor system) begins to resonate as a promising
                              environmental and business opportunity.</p>

          hippogogreen:summary: The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee passed
            an amendment on Wednesday to extend daylight saving time by two months.
            The bipartisan measure is sponsored by Rep. Fred Upton, Republican of
            Michigan, and Rep. Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.

                              <p>"The more daylight we have, the less electricity we use," Rep. Ed Markey
                              said. Markey also supported the measure by pointing out the business benefits.
                              "There's more economic activity, because people feel they can walk around
                              safely," he said.</p>

                              <p>"Extending daylight-saving time makes sense, especially with skyrocketing
                              energy costs," Rep. Fred Upton said.</p>

                              <p>The bill extends daylight saving time to begin on the first Sunday in March
                              and to end on the last Sunday in November. Daylight saving time currently begins
                              on the first Sunday in April and ends on the first Sunday in October.</p>

                              <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that extending daylight
                              saving time would save 10,000 barrels of oil per day. The United States consumes
                              approximately 20 million barrels of oil per day.</p>

                              <p>The House is planning to approve the energy bill to which the amendment was
                              attached in several weeks. Several other amendments to the bill are still being
                              debated.</p>

            scientists on the complex systems of our global climate and human activity's
            effect on it. One of the largest interactions (or "inputs") humans have
            with the atmosphere is the ever-increasing use of fossil fuels. Consumption

                              <p>Fossil fuels burnt in factories and automobiles send their waste into our
                              atmosphere in two forms. The first is
                              <a title="w:Carbon dioxide" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></a>
                              and other
                              <a title="w:Greenhouse gas" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">greenhouse
                              gases</a>, which have received substantial attention in the last few years
                              because of the way they trap heat in the atmosphere. The second is the tiny
                              particles of sulfur dioxide, soot and ash, which scientists call
                              <a title="w:Particulate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate">aerosols</a>
                              (basically smog). Research into understanding the negative health effects of air
                              pollution has resulted in the development of
                              <a title="w:catalytic converter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catalytic_converter">catalytic
                              converters</a> for cars as well as devices to remove particulate solids from
                              industrial waste before it reaches the air.</p>

                              <p>More recently, atmospheric scientists have come upon the phenomenon of the
                              reduction of direct sunlight reaching Earth's surface— observing a nearly a 5%
                              decline between 1960 and 1990, with evidence of a recovery since then. This has
                              been dubbed the
                              "<a title="w:Global dimming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming">global
                              dimming</a>" effect, and is probably due to the way these aerosols act upon
                              clouds. It is important to realise that this does <strong>not</strong>
                              represent a net loss of this much sunshine to the climate system - if so, large
                              temperature declines would have been observed. Instead, the sunshine is absorbed
                              elsewhere in the system, with a much smaller net loss.</p>

                              when moisture gathers around airborne particles, such as pollen or dust. Clouds
                              formed by the aerosol particles emitted by fossil fuel consumption are made of
                              many more tiny droplets than "natural" clouds. These smog-created clouds have
                              two notable effects: they shield sunlight from reaching Earth's surface and, due
                              to water's reflective nature, the millions of tiny droplets suspended in them
                              reflect light back into space, allowing even less light to reach Earth.</p>

                              <p>Many scientists now believe that global dimming caused by these pollutants
                              has mitigated the temperature rises brought about by
                              <a title="w:Global Warming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">global
                              warming</a>. Over the last thirty years, Earth's temperature has increased by
                              about 0.5 oC.</p>

                              <p>In the absence of global dimming, however, the Earth might be 0.3 oC warmer
                              than it currently is, suggesting that a "tug-of-war" exists between greenhouse
                              gases and particulates released by burning fossil fuels. Efforts to mitigate the
                              human health dangers of smog have allowed more heat into our atmosphere and
                              brought about a sharper increase in global warming.</p>

                              <p>Dr. James E. Hansen, professor at Columbia University and the head of the
                              Goddard Institute for Space Studies
                              <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/%7Ejeh1/">[1]</a>, believes that if we continue
                              on our current pattern, this warming could be as much as five degrees in the
                              next thirty years and ten to fourteen degrees over the course of the century.
                              Such a temperature rise would devastate life on Earth, likely bringing on a
                              cascade of self-reinforcing warming effects. Earth's forests drying and burning,
                              a steady thawing of the
                              <a title="w:Greenland" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland">Greenland</a>
                              and
                              <a title="w:Polar ice cap" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_ice_cap">arctic
                              ice sheets</a>, and, most dangerous of all, a release of the
                              <a title="w:Methane clathrate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate">methane
                              hydrates</a> that are now frozen at the bottom of the oceans, could remake the
                              planet into something inhospitable to human life. Dr. Hansen warns that,
                              according to his research, man has just 10 years to reduce greenhouse gases
                              before global warming and other responses to human activity by Earth's climate
                              reach a "tipping point", becoming unstoppable.</p>

          hippogogreen:summary: Environmental scientists say they have concrete evidence
            that the planet is undergoing the "largest mass extinction in 65 million
            years". Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the
            Earth is experiencing its "Sixth Extinction."

                              <p>Scientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this
                              century. "We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species.
                              There are about 10 million species on earth. If we carry on as we are, we could
                              lose half of all those 10 million species," Myers said.</p>

                              <p>If we do not do more, Myers says, the planet will continue to lose around 50
                              species per day compared to the natural extinction rate of one species every
                              five years. He projected this rate in the late 1980s to much criticism, but the
                              figure is now widely accepted by scientists. "The whole thing is taking place in
                              what you might call a flickering of an evolutionary eye," said Myers. "It's hard
                              to keep up with unless we damp down on some of the causes of the evolution."

                              Hotspots <br/>
                              GLOBAL WARMING: Graph shows global mean surface temperatures 1856 to 2005</p>

                              <p>The Australia Museum's Frank Howarth says "There are over 30 extinction
                              'hotspots' across the globe. He says up to 80 per cent of crucial habitat has
                              been wiped out. Biodiversity hotspots are areas that have more than 1500 endemic
                              plant species and which have lost more than 70per cent of original habitat."
                              Hotspots feature, according to Myers, "exceptional concentrations of species
                              that are found nowhere else in the world."</p>

                              <p>Evidence shows that insects, which account for more than half the described
                              species on earth, are disappearing faster than birds. "Many areas of Australia's
                              ecosystems depend on the work of insects... we put a lot of effort into looking
                              at these hotspots, about what insects actually occur there, whether their
                              numbers are increasing or decreasing, because they tell us a lot more about some
                              of the high level effects," Howarth said.</p>

                              <p>Myers argues that we are destroying the Earth’s biodiversity quickly enough
                              to witness the beginning of a mass extinction of species—one of only six such
                              events in the Earth’s history. He says around 30 hotspots contain the last
                              remaining habitats of at least half of Earth’s land surface.</p>

                              <p>He says more parks and reserves are needed, and while warnings are desperate,
                              he believes the situation can be turned around. "We would be the first
                              generation in the whole of human history since we came out of our caves to
                              tackle a mass extinction head on and cancel it... and if we do, I think people
                              will cheer for us from thousands of years ahead." Myers projects that
                              safeguarding the hotspots would cost one billion dollars per year.</p>

                              <p>The governments of the 27 countries in Brussels endorsed 3 main binding
                              targets:</p>

                              <p> * to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels by the year 2020 by 20%
                              compared to the level of 1990 <br/>
                              * renewable energy should make up 20% of energy consumption by 2020 <br/>
                              * a 10% share for biofuels in the total consumption of fuels in E.U.
                              transport.</p>

                              <p>This way, the E.U. wants to contribute in reaching the strategic goal of
                              limiting the global average temperature increase to less than 2°C above
                              pre-industrial levels. The individual targets for countries will need to be
                              established based on national starting points and potentials, according to the
                              plan. The plans don't mention an enforcement mechanism yet.</p>

                              <p>In the summit's conclusions, the E.U. underlines its ambitions as a leading
                              force in international climate protection. German Chancellor Angela Merkel
                              called the targets "ambitious and credible".</p>

                              <p>Europe is prepared to even increase the objectives if other developed
                              countries follow suit, and it invites other countries to come forward with their
                              plans for the environment beyond 2012, when the Kyoto protocol ends. In June,
                              Merkel plans to discuss the measures with the other members on the Group of
                              Eight summit.</p>

                              <p>The proposal takes into account the sovereignty of individual countries to
                              determine exactly which energy sources they use. More specifically, each member
                              state should decide if they wish to use nuclear power or not. Some countries
                              oppose the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, and Germany
                              is even in the process of dismantling its nuclear energy production. France on
                              the other hand produces 70% of its electricity in nuclear power plants. [13% of
                              France's total energy consumption is nuclear.] The report also stresses the
                              importance of nuclear safety in the discussion over nuclear energy.</p>

                              <p>The summit also asked the European Commission to come up with proposals to
                              reduce energy consumption in lighting and offices by 2008 and 2009. The idea is
                              to replace conventional light bulbs with more energy-efficient alternatives such
                              as the energy saving light bulb.</p>

                              <p>Another energy-related topic in the conclusions is an agreement on increased
                              security of energy supply. Through member state solidarity and a more
                              interconnected and integrated market, eastern European countries hope to secure
                              their energy supplies in case Russia would cut the supply.</p>

                              <p>During their two-days summit, the E.U. also discussed economic growth,
                              employment, better regulations and international relations issues.</p>

                              <p>Scientists from the
                              <a title="United Kingdom" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a>'s

                              of Leeds</a> and the

                              of Kuopio</a> in
                              <a title="Finland" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Finland">Finland</a>
                              report that the hole in the Earth's ozone layer over
                              <a title="Antarctica" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>
                              may have offset some of the effects of climate change, and that as it heals,
                              warming could accelerate. Their paper is published today in the journal
                              <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em>.</p>

                              <p>The group studied twenty years of records of global weather conditions and
                              wind speeds. They say that beneath the ozone hole, wind speeds are increased,
                              which whips up more sea spray. Salt from this is carried upwards and makes the
                              clouds brighter, reflecting more of the Sun's radiation. This helps cool the
                              Earth, counteracting the effects of global warming.</p>

                              <p>The ozone layer in the atmosphere protects life from the harmful effects of
                              ultraviolet radiation, and the discovery of its rapid depletion in the 1980s
                              caused widespread alarm. The Montreal Protocol adopted in 1987 forced countries
                              to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the man-made chemicals thought to be
                              largely responsible for the hole.</p>

                              <p>Professor Ken Carslaw, of the University of Leeds School of Earth and
                              Environment, was one of the co-authors of the paper. He warned that as the ozone
                              hole healed, warming in parts of the Southern Hemisphere could accelerate.</p>

                              <p>"If, as seems likely, these winds die down, rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions
                              could then cause the warming of the southern hemisphere to accelerate, which
                              would have an impact on future climate predictions," he said</p>

                              <p>Describing the findings as "unexpected and complex climate feedback",
                              Professor Carslaw emphasised that this research was not a reason to try and keep
                              the hole open:</p>

                              <p>"You can't correct two wrongs in that way. The ozone hole was potentially a
                              major catastrophe for the planet that was only stopped by the Montreal Protocol,
                              so we can't go back on that."</p>

                              <p>He said instead that carbon emissions should be cut drastically.</p>

                              <p>The research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the
                              Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence Programme.</p>

                              <p>Judith Perlwitz, a resercher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                              Administration, said that the group's data were sound but she disagreed with
                              some of the paper's conclusions. Perlwitz claimed that rising temperatures due
                              to global warming would increase wind speeds anyway, leading to the same effects
                              as the ozone hole.</p>

                              <p>“The question is whether the wind is really going to slow down, and that I
                              doubt,” she said.</p>

                              <p>According to a World Meteorological Organization report in 2006, it is likely
                              to be at least fifty years before the ozone above Antarctica is back to its
                              pre-1980 state</p>

                              <p>The island, located south of the
                              <a title="w:Hariabhanga river" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hariabhanga_river">Hariabhanga
                              river</a>, has been claimed by both Bangladesh and India for almost thirty
                              years, since it first appeared in the seventies. The School of Oceanographic
                              Studies in Calcutta commented that the disappearance of the island was confirmed
                              by satellite imagery.</p>

                              <p>"There’s no trace of the island anymore. After studying satellite images, I
                              reconfirmed this from fishermen," said Sugato Hazra, the director of Jadavpur
                              University’s school of oceanography studies. According to the
                              <a title="w:Times of India" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_of_India">Times
                              of India</a>, the island only appears above the water surface if there is an
                              unusually low tide. "What these two countries could not achieve from years of
                              talking has been resolved by
                              <a title="Global Warming" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Global_warming">global
                              warming</a>."</p>

                              <p>Hazra commented that, until 2000, sea levels in the area increased
                              approximately three millimetres annually, but in the past year the figure was
                              augmented to about five millimetres. The director said that ten other islands in
                              the vicinity of New Moore were in danger of being submerged as well.</p>

                              <p>Hazra attributed the island's disappearance to global warming, saying:
                              "Coastal erosion and rising temperature in the Bay of Bengal between 2000 and
                              2009 led to the Purbasha island getting submerged. Temperature in the region has
                              been rising at an annual rate of 0.4 degree celsius."</p>

                              <p>In 1996, another isle nearby,
                              <a title="w:Lohachara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lohachara">Lohachara</a>,
                              was submerged beneath the waters, displacing its inhabitants; meanwhile, the
                              <a title="w:Ghoramara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoramara">Ghoramara</a>
                              island had lost about half its land, Hazra said. "We will have ever larger
                              numbers of people displaced from the Sunderbans as more island areas come under
                              water."</p>

                              <p>According to officials, eighteen percent of the Bangladeshi coastal land will
                              be submerged if sea levels increase by one metre by 2050, and twenty million
                              people will be displaced.</p>

                              <p>In a "fireside chat" at Yale University on Wednesday, prominent naturalists
                              Edward O. Wilson and Peter H. Raven predicted dire consequences for the planet's
                              biodiversity and habitability unless current trends in consumption and
                              environmental degradation are reversed. The two scientists were awarded the
                              Addison Emery Verrill Medal by the Peabody Museum of Natural History for their
                              contributions to natural science before a capacity crowd at Yale's Sprague Hall.
                              Both are known for their environmental activism as well as extensive research
                              and popular writing.</p>

                              <p>Wilson, known for his contributions to island biogeography as well as the
                              controversial field of sociobiology, said that humans—like all earth species—are
                              adapted to this world. But most people have the dangerous attitude that this
                              world is "a waystation for a better world", warned Wilson. Humans could cause
                              the extinction of half of all species by the end of the next century, he stated.
                              The event was billed as a debate between the two scientists, but they found
                              little to disagree about. (Raven quipped that he did not care for Wilson's tie,
                              the extent of their disagreement for the evening.) Raven pointed to
                              unsustainably high levels of consumption, especially in the United States, that
                              will lead to ecological disaster if left unchecked. Levels of consumption have
                              to be cut drastically, he argued. But Wilson claimed that it would be possible
                              to maintain and even improve quality of life even while significantly reducing
                              the population's ecological footprint. Current models, he said, predict that
                              human population will peak at around 9 billion, and that "if we use what we
                              have" intelligently, the world could be a sustainable paradise by the 22nd
                              century. Raven and Wilson both argued for the compatibility of Christian and
                              environmentalist viewpoints. According to the second chapter of Genesis, said
                              Raven, man was put on the earth in order to preserve it. Wilson said that we
                              need to "form an alliance" to save life on earth—an alliance including both
                              religious and non-religious people—and that one can be a "conservative
                              right-wing Christian" and an environmentalist. His recent work, including the
                              Encyclopedia of Life, has focused on creating such an alliance. The most
                              important thing, Raven said, is to expose children to nature. Invoking the
                              argument of Rachel Carson's 1965 A Sense of Wonder, Raven said that children
                              between the ages of four and ten are extremely impressionable, and that teaching
                              them to appreciate the natural world will be the most effective way to ensure
                              environmental consciousness in the next generation. But although Raven was a
                              naturalist from a young age, he said that he "didn't give a thought to
                              conservation" while in graduate school in the 1950s. Carson's 1962 book on the
                              dangers of pesticides, Silent Spring, was Raven's introduction to dangers of
                              environmental degradation. Wilson also emphasized Carson's legacy for the
                              environmental movement; he proudly noted that Carson biographer Linda Lear had
                              recently called him the "only surviving person who actually helped Rachel
                              Carson" put together Silent Spring. Raven and Wilson were only the 16th and
                              17th, respectively, to receive the Verrill Medal, which is the highest honor
                              awarded by the Peabody Museum. Before a sympathetic crowd, Wilson tactfully
                              avoided any mention of his own institution, Yale's rival Harvard University.

                              <p>In a "fireside chat" at Yale University on Wednesday, prominent naturalists
                              Edward O. Wilson and Peter H. Raven predicted dire consequences for the planet's
                              biodiversity and habitability unless current trends in consumption and
                              environmental degradation are reversed. The two scientists were awarded the
                              Addison Emery Verrill Medal by the Peabody Museum of Natural History for their
                              contributions to natural science before a capacity crowd at Yale's Sprague Hall.
                              Both are known for their environmental activism as well as extensive research
                              and popular writing.</p>

                              <p>Wilson, known for his contributions to island biogeography as well as the
                              controversial field of sociobiology, said that humans—like all earth species—are
                              adapted to this world. But most people have the dangerous attitude that this
                              world is "a waystation for a better world", warned Wilson. Humans could cause
                              the extinction of half of all species by the end of the next century, he stated.
                              The event was billed as a debate between the two scientists, but they found
                              little to disagree about. (Raven quipped that he did not care for Wilson's tie,
                              the extent of their disagreement for the evening.) Raven pointed to
                              unsustainably high levels of consumption, especially in the United States, that
                              will lead to ecological disaster if left unchecked. Levels of consumption have
                              to be cut drastically, he argued. But Wilson claimed that it would be possible
                              to maintain and even improve quality of life even while significantly reducing
                              the population's ecological footprint. Current models, he said, predict that
                              human population will peak at around 9 billion, and that "if we use what we
                              have" intelligently, the world could be a sustainable paradise by the 22nd
                              century. Raven and Wilson both argued for the compatibility of Christian and
                              environmentalist viewpoints. According to the second chapter of Genesis, said
                              Raven, man was put on the earth in order to preserve it. Wilson said that we
                              need to "form an alliance" to save life on earth—an alliance including both
                              religious and non-religious people—and that one can be a "conservative
                              right-wing Christian" and an environmentalist. His recent work, including the
                              Encyclopedia of Life, has focused on creating such an alliance. The most
                              important thing, Raven said, is to expose children to nature. Invoking the
                              argument of Rachel Carson's 1965 A Sense of Wonder, Raven said that children
                              between the ages of four and ten are extremely impressionable, and that teaching
                              them to appreciate the natural world will be the most effective way to ensure
                              environmental consciousness in the next generation. But although Raven was a
                              naturalist from a young age, he said that he "didn't give a thought to
                              conservation" while in graduate school in the 1950s. Carson's 1962 book on the

                              environmental degradation. Wilson also emphasized Carson's legacy for the
                              environmental movement; he proudly noted that Carson biographer Linda Lear had
                              recently called him the "only surviving person who actually helped Rachel
                              Carson" put together Silent Spring. Raven and Wilson were only the 16th and

          hippogogreen:summary: In the past year, Mona Sahlin, the Swedish Minister
            for Sustainable Development, announced plans to break the nation's dependency
            on oil by 2020, without building new nuclear plants. She stated that,
            “There shall always be better alternatives to oil, which means no house
            should need oil for heating, and no driver should need to turn solely
            to petrol.”

                              <p>As part of the program, Sweden has recently organized the roles of various
                              agencies in the expansion of its wind power program.</p>

                              <p>The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences is concerned the oil supply is peaking
                              and that future high oil prices could cause global economic recession. Sweden
                              currently gets the majority of its electricity from nuclear and hydroelectric
                              power, and 26% of all its energy comes from renewables (6% is the EU average).
                              Sweden's long term aims for energy independence are partially rooted in the
                              1970s oil shocks.</p>

                              <p>In related news, Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President Stuart McGill claimed on
                              Tuesday that energy independence for the United States "is simply not feasible
                              in any time period relevant to our discussion today." He stated "No combination
                              of conservation measures, alternative energy sources and technological advances
                              could realistically and economically provide a way to completely replace those
                              imports in the short or medium term." McGill proposed "energy interdependence"
                              as the solution best suited to importing nations.</p>

              <html> <body> <p>This new turbine is
                              officially rated at 6 megawatts too, but will most likely produce 7+ megawatts (or 20
                              million kilowatt hours per year). That’s enough to power about 5,000 households of four
                              in Europe. A quick US calculation would be 938 kwh per home per month, 12 months, that’s
                              11,256 kwh per year per house. That’s 1776 American homes on one wind
                              turbine.</p> <p>The turbine being installed in Emden,
                              Germany by Enercon. They will be testing several types of storage systems in combination
                              with the multi-megawatt wind turbines.</p> <p>These turbines
                              are equipped with a number of new features: an optimized blade design with a spoiler
                              extending down to the hub, and a pre-cast concrete base. Due to the elevated hub height
                              and the new blade profile, the performance of the E-126 is expected to by far surpass
                              that of the E-112.</p> </body>

                              <p>Despite protests from Serbia, which claimed that Kosovo's independence
                              threatened its sovereignty and was illegal under international law, ten of the
                              ICJ's fourteen judges supported the non-binding motion declaring Kosovo's
                              independence legal. The move was supported by the
                              <a title="United States" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United
                              States</a> and most

                              countries, while other countries, including
                              <a title="Russia" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a> and
                              <a title="China" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China">China</a>, opposed the
                              ruling.</p>

                              <p>In its opinion on the matter, the court said that it "considers that general
                              international law does not contain any prohibition on declarations of
                              independence. Accordingly, it concludes that [Kosovo's] declaration of
                              independence on the 17th of February 2008 did not violate general international
                              law."</p>

                              <p>Even before the ruling, 69 members of the UN, out of a total of 192, had
                              recognized Kosovo's independence, and observers say that more may do so in light
                              of the ICJ's ruling.</p>

                              <p>Kosovo's president,

                              which still do not recognise the republic of Kosovo could have," while Serbian

                              <p>Even before the ruling, 69 members of the UN, out of a total of 192, had

                              <p>According to CSIRO research scientist Dr Mike Raupach, 7.9 billion tonnes of
                              carbon were emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in 2005 - a doubling
                              in the rate of increase since 1990 - and the rate of increase continues to
                              accelerate.</p>

                              <p>Data from the Cape Grim air pollution monitoring station in north-west
                              Tasmania shows carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.5% each year for the
                              past five years. "From 2000 to 2005, the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions
                              was more than 2.5% per year, whereas in the 1990s it was less than 1% per year,"
                              Dr Raupach says.</p>

                              <p>Dr Raupach, who co-chairs the international Global Carbon Project also, was
                              surprised by his research results. "It shows recent efforts globally to reduce
                              emissions have had little impact on emissions growth," he said. The CSIRO found
                              that in global terms, China has the highest current growth rate in CO2 emissions
                              although it's emissions per person are below the global average. China's
                              accumulated contribution since the start the 1800s is only five per cent of the
                              global total. The USA and Europe have each contributed more than 25% of
                              accumulated global emissions.</p>

                              <p>Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere — a separate measure to
                              carbon emissions — had also increased at an unprecedented rate. Dr Paul Fraser,
                              also from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, said that atmospheric
                              concentrations of carbon dioxide grew by two parts per million in 2005, the
                              fourth year in a row of above-average growth. "To have four years in a row of
                              above-average carbon dioxide growth is unprecedented," Dr Fraser said.</p>

                              <p>He said the trend over recent years suggests the growth rate is accelerating,
                              "signifying that fossil fuels are having an impact on greenhouse gas
                              concentrations in a way we haven’t seen in the past."</p>

                              <p>Six of the world's major polluters, who participated in this
                              week's <a title="w:New Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Asia_Pacific_Partnership_on_Clean_Development_and_Climate">Asia
                              Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (AP6 or APPCDC)</a>, have
                              launched a multi-million dollar fund to develop clean-energy, but stressed they
                              will be heavily reliant on polluting fossil-fuels for generations to come.</p>

                              <p>Green groups, labelling the talks a sham, have condemned the climate talks
                              which were held
                              in <a title="w:Sydney, Australia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney,_Australia">Sydney,
                              Australia</a> as a "coal and nuclear pact" between the big polluters and
                              fossil-fuel firms. Australian climate change observers have attacked the AP6
                              outcomes as grossly irresponsible, saying
                              the <a title="w:Australian Government" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government">Federal
                              Government</a> is willing to accept the reality of runaway climate change.</p>

                              <p>A communique released by the AP6 states: "We recognise that fossil fuels
                              underpin our economies, and will be an enduring reality for our lifetimes and
                              beyond" - the document said. Green groups say the pact has missed a vital
                              opportunity to commit to renewable energy sources. They say the two-day meeting
                              failed to make any serious commitments in combatting global warming.</p>

                              <p>Combined, the United States, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia,
                              account for around half the globe's greenhouse gases. The six countries set up
                              the summit as an ulterior method of tackling global warming outside
                              the <a title="w:Kyoto Protocol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol">Kyoto
                              Protocol</a> by, they say, focussing on "clean-energy technology."</p>

                              industry-driven environment funds were some of the proposals raised at the
                              summit. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol the six nations have not set any targets to
                              cut <a title="w:Greenhouse gases" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gases">greenhouse
                              gases</a>.</p>

                              <a title="w:Climate Change" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change">Climate
                              change</a> observers have broadly criticised the AP6 as a waste of
                              time. <a title="w:Australian Climate Institute" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Climate_Institute">Australian
                              Climate Institute's</a> Clive Hamilton says the meeting did little to cut
                              greenhouse gas emissions. "I think really this conference is about trying to
                              protect the long-term future of the coal industry," he said. "If you look at the
                              sort of business people who have a seat at the table at the conference in
                              Sydney, they overwhelmingly represent the polluting categories rather than those
                              that will at some time in the future replace them - the renewable energy and
                              energy efficiency categories."</p>

                              <p><a title="w:CSIRO" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO">CSIRO</a> chief
                              scientist Dr David Brockway says the technology required to reduce greenhouse
                              emissions is not viable for industry.</p>

                              <p>"It has to be borne in mind that anything we are going to do to reduce
                              greenhouse gas emissions and intensity from the Australian economy will come at
                              a cost," he said. "What we are doing at the moment is doing research to try and
                              reduce the size of that additional cost. I would say in a five to 10 year
                              timeframe a number of these technologies will become viable."</p>

                              <p>An AP6 communique issued at the end of the conference said reductions in
                              greenhouse gases must be achieved without hindering economic growth - "the
                              partnership aims to mobilise domestic and foreign investment into clean and
                              low-emission technology by fostering the best possible enabling environments,"
                              it states. Some of the world's big mining and energy firms attended the talks
                              and pledged to improve efficiency.</p>

                              <p>Green groups, who were left out of the conference, say the talks were aimed
                              at subverting Kyoto - which obligates some 40 developed countries to cut
                              greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels during 2008-2012.
                              "Basically, they haven't agreed to do anything in terms of serious commitment,"
                              said Monash University climate change expert Professor Amanda Lynch. The United
                              States and Australia refuse to sign Kyoto claiming its mandatory greenhouse gas
                              cuts would threaten economic growth.</p>

                              <p>
                              <a title="w:Prime Minister John Howard" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard">Australian
                              Prime Minister John Howard</a> said, "experience has taught us that seeking
                              arbitrary targets doesn't result in achieving practical solutions to global
                              climate change." Mr Howard stressed the importance of maintaining economic
                              growth to alleviate poverty, while cutting greenhouse emissions.</p>
                              <br/>

                              <p>He said the summit had injected "an overdue dose of realism into the debate
                              about climate change. We believe it is possible to tackle issues of greenhouse
                              gas emissions and the challenge of climate change without reducing living
                              standards," he said. "The world will go on using fossil fuels for many years
                              into the future because it's more economic to do so. So therefore it's
                              elementary commonsense that you should try and make the use of fossil fuels more
                              greenhouse gas sensitive, you should try and clean up the use of fossil fuel,"
                              he said.</p>

                              <p>
                              The <a title="w:World Wildlife Fund" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund">World
                              Wildlife Fund (WWF)</a> have dismissed Mr Howard's comments as misleading and
                              irresponsible. The WWF's chief executive Greg Bourne said, "in my whole business
                              career, I have never seen a more misleading public statement as that... If the
                              statements made today become a reality, this will lock us in to a four-degree
                              rise in global average temperatures, when two-degrees is considered extremely
                              dangerous," he said. "There couldn't be anything more irresponsible than to
                              knowingly embark on a path towards massive increases in emissions and runaway
                              global warming."</p>

                              <p>The AP6 nations said in the final communique that the eight public/private
                              partnership taskforces created at the conference, will draw up action plans by
                              the middle of 2013 on issues including renewable energy, power generation,
                              cleaner fossil fuels and coal mining.</p>

                              <p>Environmentalists said the Sydney pact was doomed to fail because it did not
                              impose targets on its members which comprise nearly half of humanity. The New
                              South Wales Nature Conservation Council said the group's voluntary approach was
                              a "licence for government and business to do nothing". "Without any incentives
                              or penalties there is no reason for industry to move away from burning polluting
                              coal and oil," said the council's Cate Faehrmann.</p>

                              <p>The AP6 countries encompass: 49 per cent of world GDP; 48 per cent of the
                              world energy consumption; 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions; and 45
                              per cent of the world's population.</p>

                              <p>Many scientists say global warming is melting glaciers, raising sea levels
                              and will cause more intense storms, droughts and floods. Current levels of
                              carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are higher now than at any time in
                              the past 650,000 years, research from Antarctic ice cores shows.</p>

                              showed a marked improvement in family health and student attendance. Before
                              Solvatten use, 67% of the children in the families had irregular attendance at
                              school as a result of being sick, often with waterborne diseases. After
                              purchasing Solvatten the overall attendance of children at school has increased
                              by an average of 87 percent, as stated by the parents. Before using the system
                              the typical family had someone ill three to four times per month, and that has
                              changed to only .03 times per month. Since waterborne diseases have all but
                              disappeared, people are saving money on medicines and medical services.</p>

                              the typical family had someone ill three to four times per month, and that has
                              changed to only .03 times per month. Since waterborne diseases have all but

            hippostd:content: "<p>Boston College psychology professor, Dr. Peter Gray,\
              \ writes in his book,&nbsp;\n<em>Free To Learn</em>: &ldquo;Children\
              \ are biologically predisposed to take charge of their own education.\
              \ When they are provided with the freedom and means to pursue their\
              \ own interests, in safe settings, they bloom and develop along diverse\
              \ and unpredictable paths, and they acquire the skills and confidence\
              \ required to meet life&rsquo;s challenges.&rdquo;[1]</p> \n<p>Whether\
              \ your children are still toddlers and preschoolers, or if you have\
              \ decided to homeschool, there are many ways that you can create at\
              \ home the conditions that ignite natural learning. By reimagining the\
              \ ordinary spaces of our homes as extraordinary resources for early\
              \ childhood learning, we can foster a home learning environment that\
              \ sparks curiosity, engages children naturally in discovery of their\
              \ world, and cultivates a more peaceful home life.</p> \n<p><strong>Here\
              \ are 10 simple ideas for re-envisioning your home as a powerful place\
              \ for natural learning:</strong></p> \n<h2>Freedom</h2> \n<p>You are\
              \ a facilitator of freedom, a protector of the conditions of natural\
              \ childhood learning. You simply listen, and watch, and then you help\
              \ to gather or find resources that help your child to learn naturally\
              \ as he is innately designed to do. You bridge the gap between your\
              \ child&rsquo;s nascent interests and ideas and the vast world around\
              \ him.</p> \n<p>As pioneering early childhood educator, John Holt, wrote\
              \ in his classic book,&nbsp;\n<em>Teach Your Own</em>: &ldquo;What children\
              \ need is not new and better curricula but access to more and more of\
              \ the real world; plenty of time and space to think over their experiences,\
              \ and to use fantasy and play to make meaning out of them; and advice,\
              \ road maps, guidebooks, to make it easier for them to get where they\
              \ want to go (not where we think they ought to go), and to find out\
              \ what they want to find out.&rdquo;[2]</p> \n<p>As a parent, you protect\
              \ this freedom&mdash;the time and space for natural learning&mdash;and\
              \ connect your child&rsquo;s burgeoning passions with the abundant resources\
              \ of your community.</p> \n<h2>Play</h2> \n<p>The deepest learning,\
              \ especially for children, comes when they are doing something they\
              \ enjoy, in the spirit of play. And when this play is unstructured and\
              \ child-led, the learning that results is richer and more meaningful.</p>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Recent research by a team of psychologists\
              \ at the University of Colorado reveals the benefits of play-based learning.\
              \ In their study, the researchers found that the more opportunity children\
              \ had for free, unstructured, unsupervised play time&ndash;as opposed\
              \ to organized play like sports and classes&mdash;the higher their &ldquo;Executive\
              \ Functioning&rdquo; skills were. The children who were given more time\
              \ for free play were better equipped to establish their own goals, be\
              \ more self-directed, more organized, and more self-regulating than\
              \ children engaged in more structured, supervised activities.[3]</p>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Give your children the freedom to\
              \ play. Make unstructured play time the priority over classes and lessons.\
              \ Let your child lead and be the director of her play while you hold\
              \ the space for this deep learning to occur.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Warmth</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Natural learning comes\
              \ easily from a warm and inviting space. Keep natural toys and materials,\
              \ de-clutter, and incorporate homemade items into play-spaces to&nbsp;create\
              \ an enriching learning environment.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Consider donating half of your child&rsquo;s current toys to simplify\
              \ and calm their space. The fewer the toys, the more deeply they will\
              \ play with those that are left.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >For your remaining toys, select high-quality, non-commercial toys made\
              \ from natural materials like wood and wool. These natural toys trigger\
              \ a child&rsquo;s imagination in ways that manufactured plastic cannot.</p>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">And think creatively about special\
              \ &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for young children. Playing with a ball of yarn\
              \ or a basket of clothespins, while a grown-up watches nearby, can be\
              \ great fun for babies and toddlers. Fill your play-spaces with warmth\
              \ by showcasing the homemade. Drape a piece of string or yarn across\
              \ a window or wall and clip your child&rsquo;s artwork to it. Frame\
              \ your child&rsquo;s art for all to admire. Sprinkle handmades into\
              \ your play-spaces, with a homemade pillows or a knitted blanket, adding\
              \ warmth and inspiration to your home.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Curiosity</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Spark your child&rsquo;s\
              \ natural curiosity with baskets of books scattered throughout your\
              \ home. Gather &ldquo;coffee table books,&rdquo; and other large, colorful\
              \ books to include in your play-spaces for children to explore. Make\
              \ tools for child-directed learning readily available and accessible,\
              \ like wooden blocks and letters, puzzles, microscopes and magnifying\
              \ glasses, dress-up clothes and play silks. Set up a book nook or a\
              \ nature corner or a music alcove.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Envision your home as an incubator of curiosity and imagination, with\
              \ nooks and crannies offering enjoyable spaces for learning and discovery.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Creativity</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Think of ways to cultivate creativity in your home. Prepare a morning\
              \ art table for your toddler or preschooler to stumble upon. Fill it\
              \ with paper and crayons, tape and glue, magazines to cut up, or different\
              \ materials to explore.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">For older\
              \ children, designate a space in your home as your constant &ldquo;creativity\
              \ corner,&rdquo; with art supplies ready and waiting when inspiration\
              \ hits. Filling our homes with creative spaces for our children help\
              \ them to direct their own learning, reveal their own interests, and\
              \ pursue their own passions without waiting for grown-ups to lead the\
              \ way.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Rhythm</h2> \n<p style=\"\
              text-align:start\">When we think of simple ways to integrate our children\
              \ into the daily rhythms of home&ndash;involving them in household projects,\
              \ inviting them to move through the day alongside us&ndash;we find that\
              \ our days at home can be more peaceful, more enjoyable, and more productive\
              \ than we ever thought possible.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >By re-envisioning our home and the daily tasks we complete within it\
              \ as important to our child&rsquo;s early learning and development,\
              \ we begin to see that our role is not to entertain our children, not\
              \ to occupy them, but to welcome them into the daily rhythms of our\
              \ life and work. Yes, it will take longer&mdash;perhaps much longer&mdash;to\
              \ fold that pile of clothes or bake those cookies, but when we see our\
              \ home-based activities&mdash;like cleaning and cooking&mdash;as central\
              \ to our child&rsquo;s learning, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it\
              \ takes longer than it otherwise would. It&rsquo;s not something to\
              \ get through quickly so you can play with the train set on the floor.\
              \ Instead, it&nbsp;\n<em>is</em>&nbsp;the learning activity for that\
              \ time of the day, for that moment, and it is deeply worthwhile.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Nourishment</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Just as folding the laundry can become a learning activity in and of\
              \ itself for young children&ndash;an exercise in sorting and organizing,\
              \ identifying shapes and colors in a natural way as part of the ordinary\
              \ cadence of the day&mdash;so too can cooking and baking.</p> \n<p style=\"\
              text-align:start\">Instead of feeling the need to buy play-dough, for\
              \ instance, and find a set time for using it with your toddler or preschooler,\
              \ instead make basic pizza dough for dinner. Mix some flour, water,\
              \ yeast, and oil following a basic pizza dough recipe, and then let\
              \ your child play with it, roll it, knead it, squish it, while you move\
              \ on to saut&eacute;ing your mushrooms or preparing your salad. In this\
              \ way, your child becomes actively involved in the daily rhythms of\
              \ home while engaged in age-appropriate play with homemade ingredients\
              \ that will nourish hungry bellies.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Playing with dough, then, becomes seamlessly integrated into your day\
              \ instead of an extra playtime activity. The same could be true of starting\
              \ a simple herb garden with your child, picking strawberries or applies,\
              \ visiting farms and farmers&rsquo; markets, making jam, or searching\
              \ for wild edibles on a nature walk around town. All of these activities\
              \ are connected to your daily rhythms of feeding and caring for young\
              \ children, and all present extraordinary learning opportunities.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Ritual</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Children learn much through rituals. Different from routines that are\
              \ rigid and structured and automatic, rituals are fluid and evolving\
              \ and designed to celebrate daily, weekly, and seasonal moments. Enjoying\
              \ a cup of tea every afternoon with your child. Celebrating Friday nights\
              \ with breakfast-for-dinner and a family movie. Welcoming the autumn\
              \ equinox with apple-picking and a harvest meal. These are all examples\
              \ of rituals that you can incorporate into your home life. They help\
              \ children to mark the passing of time, to appreciate the changing seasons\
              \ and the natural cycle of the earth. They foster family togetherness\
              \ and position home as the central source for growth and discovery.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Nature</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Prioritizing nature, and integrating the natural world into your everyday\
              \ rhythms, can be an important way to spark natural learning with little\
              \ ones. Take a daily nature walk. Go puddle stomping. Jump in autumn\
              \ leaves. Catch snowflakes. Create a seasonal nature table, gathering\
              \ items from your neighborhood to bring into your home and weave into\
              \ your child&rsquo;s play. Collect nature-based &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for\
              \ your child, such as acorns and tree bark, shells and rocks. These\
              \ simple activities connect children to nature in important ways and\
              \ spark curiosity.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Community</h2>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Learning at home with little ones\
              \ is not an isolated endeavor. Build community by joining your local\
              \ homeschooling network, most of which have designated play dates or\
              \ park days for preschool-age children.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Seek community resources for learning, such as museums and libraries,\
              \ nature centers and farms, colleges and non-profits, local shops and\
              \ community-based organizations. Many of these community resources have\
              \ classes for young children and all can serve as helpful hubs for fostering\
              \ natural learning.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">When we begin\
              \ to see our home and our daily rhythms as an integral part of our child&rsquo;s\
              \ learning, the whole idea of living and learning at home with our little\
              \ ones becomes much less daunting. We spot simple ways to integrate\
              \ our children into the daily learning all around us, and provide the\
              \ important conditions of freedom and play, warmth and nourishment to\
              \ make learning happen. We can live and learn joyfully with our children,\
              \ using their natural zest for discovery as our beacon.</p>"

              \ takes longer than it otherwise would. It&rsquo;s not something to\
              \ get through quickly so you can play with the train set on the floor.\
              \ Instead, it&nbsp;\n<em>is</em>&nbsp;the learning activity for that\
              \ time of the day, for that moment, and it is deeply worthwhile.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Nourishment</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Just as folding the laundry can become a learning activity in and of\
              \ itself for young children&ndash;an exercise in sorting and organizing,\
              \ identifying shapes and colors in a natural way as part of the ordinary\
              \ cadence of the day&mdash;so too can cooking and baking.</p> \n<p style=\"\
              text-align:start\">Instead of feeling the need to buy play-dough, for\
              \ instance, and find a set time for using it with your toddler or preschooler,\
              \ instead make basic pizza dough for dinner. Mix some flour, water,\
              \ yeast, and oil following a basic pizza dough recipe, and then let\
              \ your child play with it, roll it, knead it, squish it, while you move\
              \ on to saut&eacute;ing your mushrooms or preparing your salad. In this\
              \ way, your child becomes actively involved in the daily rhythms of\
              \ home while engaged in age-appropriate play with homemade ingredients\
              \ that will nourish hungry bellies.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Playing with dough, then, becomes seamlessly integrated into your day\
              \ instead of an extra playtime activity. The same could be true of starting\
              \ a simple herb garden with your child, picking strawberries or applies,\
              \ visiting farms and farmers&rsquo; markets, making jam, or searching\
              \ for wild edibles on a nature walk around town. All of these activities\
              \ are connected to your daily rhythms of feeding and caring for young\
              \ children, and all present extraordinary learning opportunities.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Ritual</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Children learn much through rituals. Different from routines that are\
              \ rigid and structured and automatic, rituals are fluid and evolving\
              \ and designed to celebrate daily, weekly, and seasonal moments. Enjoying\
              \ a cup of tea every afternoon with your child. Celebrating Friday nights\
              \ with breakfast-for-dinner and a family movie. Welcoming the autumn\
              \ equinox with apple-picking and a harvest meal. These are all examples\
              \ of rituals that you can incorporate into your home life. They help\
              \ children to mark the passing of time, to appreciate the changing seasons\
              \ and the natural cycle of the earth. They foster family togetherness\
              \ and position home as the central source for growth and discovery.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Nature</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Prioritizing nature, and integrating the natural world into your everyday\
              \ rhythms, can be an important way to spark natural learning with little\
              \ ones. Take a daily nature walk. Go puddle stomping. Jump in autumn\
              \ leaves. Catch snowflakes. Create a seasonal nature table, gathering\
              \ items from your neighborhood to bring into your home and weave into\
              \ your child&rsquo;s play. Collect nature-based &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for\
              \ your child, such as acorns and tree bark, shells and rocks. These\
              \ simple activities connect children to nature in important ways and\
              \ spark curiosity.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Community</h2>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Learning at home with little ones\
              \ is not an isolated endeavor. Build community by joining your local\
              \ homeschooling network, most of which have designated play dates or\
              \ park days for preschool-age children.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Seek community resources for learning, such as museums and libraries,\
              \ nature centers and farms, colleges and non-profits, local shops and\
              \ community-based organizations. Many of these community resources have\
              \ classes for young children and all can serve as helpful hubs for fostering\
              \ natural learning.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">When we begin\
              \ to see our home and our daily rhythms as an integral part of our child&rsquo;s\
              \ learning, the whole idea of living and learning at home with our little\
              \ ones becomes much less daunting. We spot simple ways to integrate\
              \ our children into the daily learning all around us, and provide the\
              \ important conditions of freedom and play, warmth and nourishment to\
              \ make learning happen. We can live and learn joyfully with our children,\
              \ using their natural zest for discovery as our beacon.</p>"

            hippostd:content: "<p>Boston College psychology professor, Dr. Peter Gray,\
              \ writes in his book,&nbsp;\n<em>Free To Learn</em>: &ldquo;Children\
              \ are biologically predisposed to take charge of their own education.\
              \ When they are provided with the freedom and means to pursue their\
              \ own interests, in safe settings, they bloom and develop along diverse\
              \ and unpredictable paths, and they acquire the skills and confidence\
              \ required to meet life&rsquo;s challenges.&rdquo;[1]</p> \n<p>Whether\
              \ your children are still toddlers and preschoolers, or if you have\
              \ decided to homeschool, there are many ways that you can create at\
              \ home the conditions that ignite natural learning. By reimagining the\
              \ ordinary spaces of our homes as extraordinary resources for early\
              \ childhood learning, we can foster a home learning environment that\
              \ sparks curiosity, engages children naturally in discovery of their\
              \ world, and cultivates a more peaceful home life.</p> \n<p><strong>Here\
              \ are 10 simple ideas for re-envisioning your home as a powerful place\
              \ for natural learning:</strong></p> \n<h2>Freedom</h2> \n<p>You are\
              \ a facilitator of freedom, a protector of the conditions of natural\
              \ childhood learning. You simply listen, and watch, and then you help\
              \ to gather or find resources that help your child to learn naturally\
              \ as he is innately designed to do. You bridge the gap between your\
              \ child&rsquo;s nascent interests and ideas and the vast world around\
              \ him.</p> \n<p>As pioneering early childhood educator, John Holt, wrote\
              \ in his classic book,&nbsp;\n<em>Teach Your Own</em>: &ldquo;What children\
              \ need is not new and better curricula but access to more and more of\
              \ the real world; plenty of time and space to think over their experiences,\
              \ and to use fantasy and play to make meaning out of them; and advice,\
              \ road maps, guidebooks, to make it easier for them to get where they\
              \ want to go (not where we think they ought to go), and to find out\
              \ what they want to find out.&rdquo;[2]</p> \n<p>As a parent, you protect\
              \ this freedom&mdash;the time and space for natural learning&mdash;and\
              \ connect your child&rsquo;s burgeoning passions with the abundant resources\
              \ of your community.</p> \n<h2>Play</h2> \n<p>The deepest learning,\
              \ especially for children, comes when they are doing something they\
              \ enjoy, in the spirit of play. And when this play is unstructured and\
              \ child-led, the learning that results is richer and more meaningful.</p>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Recent research by a team of psychologists\
              \ at the University of Colorado reveals the benefits of play-based learning.\
              \ In their study, the researchers found that the more opportunity children\
              \ had for free, unstructured, unsupervised play time&ndash;as opposed\
              \ to organized play like sports and classes&mdash;the higher their &ldquo;Executive\
              \ Functioning&rdquo; skills were. The children who were given more time\
              \ for free play were better equipped to establish their own goals, be\
              \ more self-directed, more organized, and more self-regulating than\
              \ children engaged in more structured, supervised activities.[3]</p>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Give your children the freedom to\
              \ play. Make unstructured play time the priority over classes and lessons.\
              \ Let your child lead and be the director of her play while you hold\
              \ the space for this deep learning to occur.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Warmth</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Natural learning comes\
              \ easily from a warm and inviting space. Keep natural toys and materials,\
              \ de-clutter, and incorporate homemade items into play-spaces to&nbsp;create\
              \ an enriching learning environment.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Consider donating half of your child&rsquo;s current toys to simplify\
              \ and calm their space. The fewer the toys, the more deeply they will\
              \ play with those that are left.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >For your remaining toys, select high-quality, non-commercial toys made\
              \ from natural materials like wood and wool. These natural toys trigger\
              \ a child&rsquo;s imagination in ways that manufactured plastic cannot.</p>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">And think creatively about special\
              \ &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for young children. Playing with a ball of yarn\
              \ or a basket of clothespins, while a grown-up watches nearby, can be\
              \ great fun for babies and toddlers. Fill your play-spaces with warmth\
              \ by showcasing the homemade. Drape a piece of string or yarn across\
              \ a window or wall and clip your child&rsquo;s artwork to it. Frame\
              \ your child&rsquo;s art for all to admire. Sprinkle handmades into\
              \ your play-spaces, with a homemade pillows or a knitted blanket, adding\

              \ instance, and find a set time for using it with your toddler or preschooler,\
              \ instead make basic pizza dough for dinner. Mix some flour, water,\
              \ yeast, and oil following a basic pizza dough recipe, and then let\
              \ your child play with it, roll it, knead it, squish it, while you move\
              \ on to saut&eacute;ing your mushrooms or preparing your salad. In this\
              \ way, your child becomes actively involved in the daily rhythms of\
              \ home while engaged in age-appropriate play with homemade ingredients\
              \ that will nourish hungry bellies.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Playing with dough, then, becomes seamlessly integrated into your day\
              \ instead of an extra playtime activity. The same could be true of starting\
              \ a simple herb garden with your child, picking strawberries or applies,\
              \ visiting farms and farmers&rsquo; markets, making jam, or searching\
              \ for wild edibles on a nature walk around town. All of these activities\
              \ are connected to your daily rhythms of feeding and caring for young\
              \ children, and all present extraordinary learning opportunities.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Ritual</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Children learn much through rituals. Different from routines that are\
              \ rigid and structured and automatic, rituals are fluid and evolving\
              \ and designed to celebrate daily, weekly, and seasonal moments. Enjoying\
              \ a cup of tea every afternoon with your child. Celebrating Friday nights\
              \ with breakfast-for-dinner and a family movie. Welcoming the autumn\
              \ equinox with apple-picking and a harvest meal. These are all examples\
              \ of rituals that you can incorporate into your home life. They help\
              \ children to mark the passing of time, to appreciate the changing seasons\
              \ and the natural cycle of the earth. They foster family togetherness\
              \ and position home as the central source for growth and discovery.</p>\
              \ \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Nature</h2> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Prioritizing nature, and integrating the natural world into your everyday\
              \ rhythms, can be an important way to spark natural learning with little\
              \ ones. Take a daily nature walk. Go puddle stomping. Jump in autumn\
              \ leaves. Catch snowflakes. Create a seasonal nature table, gathering\
              \ items from your neighborhood to bring into your home and weave into\
              \ your child&rsquo;s play. Collect nature-based &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for\
              \ your child, such as acorns and tree bark, shells and rocks. These\
              \ simple activities connect children to nature in important ways and\
              \ spark curiosity.</p> \n<h2 style=\"text-align:start\">Community</h2>\
              \ \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">Learning at home with little ones\
              \ is not an isolated endeavor. Build community by joining your local\
              \ homeschooling network, most of which have designated play dates or\
              \ park days for preschool-age children.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\"\
              >Seek community resources for learning, such as museums and libraries,\
              \ nature centers and farms, colleges and non-profits, local shops and\
              \ community-based organizations. Many of these community resources have\
              \ classes for young children and all can serve as helpful hubs for fostering\
              \ natural learning.</p> \n<p style=\"text-align:start\">When we begin\
              \ to see our home and our daily rhythms as an integral part of our child&rsquo;s\
              \ learning, the whole idea of living and learning at home with our little\
              \ ones becomes much less daunting. We spot simple ways to integrate\
              \ our children into the daily learning all around us, and provide the\
              \ important conditions of freedom and play, warmth and nourishment to\
              \ make learning happen. We can live and learn joyfully with our children,\
              \ using their natural zest for discovery as our beacon.</p>"

                              storages. Though somewhat dependent on end-use and maintenance, yields are
                              usually of acceptable quality for most household needs and renewable at
                              acceptable volumes, despite climate change forecasts. It produces beneficial
                              effects by reducing peak storm water runoff and processing costs. Rainwater
                              harvesting systems are simple to install and operate. Running costs are
                              negligible, and they provide water at the point of consumption.</p>

                              <p>In municipalities with systems, reducing storm runoff is especially
                              important, because excess runoff during heavy storms leads to the discharge of
                              raw sewage when treatment plant capacity cannot handle the combined flow.
                              Rainwater harvesting in urban communities has been made possible by various
                              companies. Sometimes a practice is adopted of directing collected rainwater deep
                              inside the ground through pipes or shafts. Such a practice will carry surface
                              pollutants to the ground water and thus pollute it. The best practice is to
                              store water in ponds, lakes and other unlined surface reservoirs so that the
                              water gets filtered through before entering the ground.</p>

                              your organic home delivery service. Here our top three things to do to help our
                              planet when getting your goods to your customers.  </p>

                              <ol>
                              <li>Turn off the air condition - Did you know that your cool air doubles your
                              fuel consumption? Seriously, everybody will understand if you smell a little for
                              saving some gas. Think about making a t-shirt explaining the odor.</li>
                              <li>Charge for plastic bags - Charge 5 dollars for every plastic bag, if you
                              don’t get one in return. Accept ripped ones too. You’ll see how that makes those
                              bags come back to you.</li>
                              <li>Don’t come back if they are out - Leave your products on their door step,
                              even if nobody’s home.– after all, that’s why you agree to delivery times. Offer
                              lockable crates  to avoid next door’s raccoon having a go at your customer’s
                              food.</li>

            If there is one thing, Chicago will never be short of, then it’s winds –
                          that’s for sure. What a clever idea of Greenway to bring this – usually annoying
                          feature – to good use in the new Greenway Self-Park garage with these impressive
                          wind turbines.

                              <p>The turbines are powering all exterior lighting of the car park and all
                              excess power is going back into the grid for other electricity use – an
                              estimated 15,000 kWh per year.</p>

                              <p>That’s pretty impressive, especially because they start generating power at
                              two mph, far lower than standard turbines. Even more importantly, they can cope
                              with Chicago’s severe weather conditions as well. By placing the turbines in the
                              southwest of the building, they make most use of the southwest summer and
                              northwest winter winds in Chicago.</p>

                              <p>But Greenway didn’t stop there: A green roof to keep Chicago cool and collect
                              rain water for maintenance and a Low-e glass that will mean less energy spending
                              for the shopping areas on the ground floor.</p>

                              <p>And guess what? No construction material travelled further than 500 miles to
                              get to Chicago.</p>

                              <p>Green thumbs up from us for this great project!</p>

                              <p>It’s not only people with awkward haircuts anymore, who care about how they
                              build their next home. Building eco-friendly and sustainable housing has reached
                              the broad middle classes. </p>

                              <p>Architects and designers better brush up on the basics. Here some simple
                              ideas to make a big difference:</p>

                              <ul>
                              <li>Green roofs – great, because they insulate the house, contribute to the
                              city’s green lung, keep the temperature down and hey - make butterflies happy.
                              </li>
                              <li>Collect rain water – assuming you actually have some rain to collect…
                              doesn’t take much and your roof provides enough water for flushing the toilet or
                              watering the garden.</li>
                              <li>Use the sun – get some solar panels on your green roof and power your heat
                              up your shower water. Two benefits in one: You save electricity AND safe water,
                              especially in areas where it’s rather cloudy.</li>
                              </ul>

                              Tesla shares are trading at $15.70. That's a steep decline from the company's ending
                              price on June 29, when the stock was made public. On that day, shares ended up 70
                              percent at $23.89 per share. On June 30, the stock hit a high of $30.42 per
                              share.</p> <p>From a purely financial perspective, some
                              might not think Tesla the most viable investment target. The green automaker sells
                              expensive cars, headlined by its $109,000 Roadster, that have yet to catch on across the
                              world. According to Tesla, it's sold about 1,000 Roadsters since the company's
                              inception. And in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it said
                              it it expects "the rate at which [it] will incur losses to increase significantly" as
                              the company continues to expand its operations.</p> <p>That
                              doesn't typically inspire confidence in investors, especially when the company lost $55
                              million last year alone.</p> <p>Tesla did not immediately
                              respond to request for comment.</p> <p> </p>

            at Swiss universities, ended its journey of traveling around the world
            at the United Nations climate talks in Poznań, Poland. Yvo de Boer, the
            Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,
            rode into Poznań in the vehicle, along with schoolteacher Louis Palmer.

                              <p>The two-seat car began its journey 17 months ago in Lucerne, Switzerland.
                              Carrying solar cells on a trailer, the car sent the message that global warming
                              can be stopped and there are better alternatives.</p>

                              <p>"This is the first time in history that a solar-powered car has travelled all
                              the way around the world without using a single drop of petrol," said Palmer.
                              "These new technologies are ready. It's ecological, it's economical, it is
                              absolutely reliable. We can stop global warming."</p>

                              <p>Many people have been carried by the solar car, including New York City Mayor
                              Michael Bloomberg and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.</p>

                              <p>The conference in Poznań seeks to draft a new climate treaty that would
                              replace the Kyoto protocol, which is set to expire in 2012. The delegates hope
                              to finalize the treaty by December 2009, when the UN reconvenes on the climate
                              in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

                              <p>"Here at the conference, we are talking about reducing emissions by 10 or 20
                              percent," Palmer said. "I want to show that we can reduce emissions by 100
                              percent — and that's what we need for the future."</p>

            gas emissions "in the range of" 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and
            83 percent by 2050. Obama will attend the Copenhagen international climate
            meeting next month, and is going to offer these figures as an official
            climate change policy.

                              <p>Obama has also set interim targets for better intermediate control. These are
                              a 30% cut by 2025 and a 42% cut by 2030. But Obama's climate change speeches
                              aren't going very far: Mr Obama is not planning to be present at the summit
                              during the last days, when the world leaders might most possibly finally make a
                              treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol.</p>

                              <p>To compare, the European Union speaks about cutting its emissions by 20% cut
                              by 2020 and 80% by 2050. But the starting point of the EU and of most of other
                              nations is 1990, while Obama's numbers are in terms of 2005 emissions. The plans
                              proposed by Obama are with a steeper end compared with EU, thus making a slower
                              start.</p>

                              <p>Observers say some accumulation effect can be caused by domestic policies,
                              which take long to implement on a proper scale, but then give a faster emissions
                              cut. Such policies can include improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency,
                              categories-specific limitations, etc.</p>

                              <p>The car model, which is known as the T.27, is due to be developed over the
                              course of the next 16 months with four prototypes. The process that will be used
                              during the course of the manufacturing of the vehicle is called iStream. The
                              technology iStream had been invented by Gordon Murray in 1999 and means that all
                              the parts are designed using a computer.</p>

                              <p>The project has approximately received £9,000,000 (US$14,919,000) in
                              investment. The electric car is designed for urban purposes, such as in cities
                              or towns. The weight of the vehicle is just 600 kilograms. It has the ability to
                              travel at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour and can go for a maximum of 100
                              miles between recharges.</p>

                              <p>The designer thinks that motorists will some day be travelling in vehicles
                              like this. Murray believes that the new car will be 'the most efficient electric
                              vehicle on earth'.</p>

              <html> <body> <p>Walk along the
                              Kalverstraat or Leidseplein, and Amsterdam, just like any European city, offers plenty
                              of retail therapy to make the heartiest shopper blush. And that retail therapy includes
                              discount clothing giants like C&amp;A and H&amp;M. Now a coalition of
                              retailers, from IKEA to Carrefour, have a announced a Code for Environmentally
                              Sustainable Business. <br/> This coalition between the European Retail
                              Round Table (ERRT) and EuroCommerce claims that it is committing retailers to improve
                              their operations in six areas: </p> <ol>
                              <li>Sourcing, by promoting more environmentally sustainable sourcing and
                              production of products.</li> <li>Resource efficiency, by
                              improving the environmental performance of the retailers' premises.</li>
                              <li>Transport and distribution, by improving the environmental performance
                              of distribution and where the retailer does not operate its own fleet, working with
                              transport providers, as well as by supporting the sustainable mobility of customers and
                              workers.</li> <li>Waste management, by putting in practice
                              measures aiming to prevent or reduce the impact of waste on the
                              environment.</li> <li>Communication, that is, encouraging
                              more sustainable consumption and which promote responsible consumer behavior regarding
                              product use and disposal.</li> <li>Reporting, by regularly
                              reporting on the above commitments, which to some may seem like cheating, so let's just
                              say there are 5 areas.</li> </ol> <p>If these
                              proclamations all sounds very vague and broad at the same time, that is because they
                              are. The code is completely voluntary, and in an economy that as an aggregate is larger
                              than that of the United States, so far 21 chains and 7 retail associations have signed
                              up. <br/> It makes for great public relations and "We Care" campaigns, but
                              so far the Code as it stands has not explained how participating companies can measure
                              and compare their efforts. And as for reporting, there is no agreed upon standard.

              <html> <body> <p>After carbon dioxide,
                              the substance most crucial in determining how climate change will play out over the next
                              century and beyond isn't a greenhouse gas — it's the solid state of the molecule H20.
                              Summer melt in the sea ice that covers the Arctic Ocean exposes heat-absorbing seawater
                              to the sun, accelerating global warming in a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification.
                              Summer melting in the land-based ice that covers Greenland is increasingly responsible
                              for the sea-level rise that has already begun to endanger many thousands of miles of
                              coastline. Glaciers moving more rapidly to the sea, in both Greenland and Antarctica,
                              threaten to raise sea level even higher, while disappearing mountain glaciers around the
                              world could choke off water supplies to many hundreds of millions of
                              people.</p> <p>That being the case, it's crucial to know
                              exactly what’s happening to the ice as the planet warms up. So it's easy to understand
                              why the European Space Agency was horrified when its ice-measuring CryoSat satellite
                              failed on launch back in October 2005 — and that the agency was thrilled when CryoSat-2
                              lifted off successfully this April from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The
                              satellite is now in its shakedown phase, where scientists check out the instruments and
                              solar panels, and it seems to be working perfectly. "There's no precedent for such a
                              rapid recovery," says CryoSat Mission Scientist Mark Drinkwater. "We're up there,
                              collecting great data."</p> <p>It's not that ice-watchers
                              have been flying blind since 2005. A virtual flotilla of satellites, some dedicated
                              entirely to looking down on the planet's white places and others only partly devoted to
                              sensing ice, has been whirling overhead for more than three decades. The result has been
                              an unbroken record of observations, starting with NASA's Nimbus-7 satellite in 1978,
                              showing such key phenomena as the steady, three-decade disappearance of Arctic sea ice.
                              Since the late-1970s, NASA and space agencies from other nations have devised an array
                              of detectors to measure ice from space, using wavelengths spanning the electromagnetic
                              spectrum, from microwaves, to infrared, to visible light.</p>
                              <p>Just as cell phones, computers, DVD players, and other once-exotic
                              devices have plummeted in price and soared in capability over the years, so have the
                              electronics at the heart of high-flying satellites. The satellites' vision has in effect
                              become sharper, and the data they return richer in detail. Satellites have even managed
                              to transcend light entirely: the GRACE satellite array now routinely measures changes in
                              local gravity resulting from mass losses in ice sheets.</p>
                              <p>But each orbiter has a limited lifetime even when it's working
                              perfectly, and some break down prematurely...</p> </body>

                              discuss how the treaty will be upheld at Copenhagen. Diplomats have raised the
                              question of reliability, since most of the supporting countries have not
                              enforced any binding climate legislation within their own countries. Until it is
                              shown that all countries participating will uphold the treaty, nations are
                              unwilling to enforce a treaty within their own country.</p>

                              <p>Although there are hopes of progress in Copenhagen, observes note that
                              radical change is unlikely. "The most likely form any agreement will take will
                              be a political declaration," said Nigel Purvis, State Department climate
                              negotiator during

              <html> <body> <p>At first the terms
                              elves and sprites implies a certain almost mythic note. They are an electrical discharge
                              associated with thunderstorms but normally above them as opposed to what most people see
                              from underneath a thunderstorm. They are best observed from beyond the earth.
                              <br/> Elves often appear as a dim, flattened, expanding glow around 250
                              miles in diameter that lasts for typically one millisecond. They occur in the ionosphere
                              60 miles above the ground over thunderstorms. Elves is an acronym for Global Warming of Light
                              and Very Low Frequency Perturbations from Electromagnetic Pulse Sources.
                              <br/> Sprites are large scale electrical discharges which occur high above
                              a thunderstorm cloud, giving rise to a varied range of visual shapes. The phenomena were
                              named after the mischievous sprite (air spirit) Puck in William Shakespeare's A
                              Midsummer Night's Dream. They normally are colored reddish orange or greenish blue, with
                              hanging tendrils below. They often occur in clusters above the Earth's surface. Sprites
                              have sometimes been held responsible for otherwise unexplained accidents involving high
                              altitude aircraft flying above thunderstorms. <br/> A team of Spanish
                              researchers has made a recent high speed recording of elves and sprites in storms,
                              fleeting and luminous electric phenomena produced in the upper layers of the atmosphere.
                              Their analysis of these observations has been published in the Journal of Geophysical
                              Research. <br/> The results show there are many fewer elves in storms that
                              form over land than those at sea, apparently due to winter storms having greater energy.
                              The scientists also observed the interaction between two sprites. A branch of one of
                              them hit and bounced off the second, giving clues about their dynamics and electric
                              structure. <br/> These elves and sprites are illustrative of the many
                              phenomena that are not clearly known because of their relative rarity and
                              briefness. </p> </body> </html>

                              good way to reduce damage to the climate.</p>

                              <p>Pachuari said that
                              "the <a title="w:UN Food and Agriculture Organization" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Food_and_Agriculture_Organization">UN
                              Food and Agriculture Organization</a> (FAO) has estimated that direct emissions
                              from meat production account for about 18% of the world's total greenhouse gas
                              emissions," when explaining the reasons behind his comment. "So I want to
                              highlight the fact that among options for mitigating climate change, changing
                              diets is something one should consider."</p>

                              <p>"In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about
                              reductions in a short period of time, it [giving up meat] clearly is the most
                              attractive opportunity," continued the climate scientist. "Give up meat for one
                              day [a week] initially, and decrease it from there."</p>

                              <p>Joyce D'Silva, a spokesperson
                              for <a title="w:Compassion in World Farming" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_in_World_Farming">Compassion
                              in World Farming</a> agreed with Pachuari. "Surveys show people are anxious
                              about their personal carbon footprints and cutting back on car journeys and so
                              on; but they may not realize that changing what's on their plate could have an
                              even bigger effect," she said in response to the comments made by the UN climate
                              scientist.</p>

                              <p>
                              The <a title="w:National Farmers Union (England and Wales)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Union_(England_and_Wales)">National
                              Farmers Union</a> said that people should find ways of environmental farming
                              instead of giving up meat. "The NFU is committed to ensuring farming is part of
                              the solution to climate change, rather than being part of the problem," said a
                              spokesperson for the organization. "We strongly support research aimed at
                              reducing methane emissions from livestock farming by, for example, changing
                              diets and using anaerobic digestion."</p>

                              hopes to increase appreciation of global climate issues. There will also be a
                              Washington exhibit relating to environmental issues viewed from space as well.

                              <p>At the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center activities will focus on their
                              slogan for Earth Day 2009, "Just One Drop ... PRICELESS" and will demonstrate
                              how the Environmental Control Life Support System operates as used on the
                              International Space Staton (ISS).</p>

                              <p>Amongst the many festivals, WorldFest is a solar powered music celebration
                              held in Los Angeles, California. Buenos Aires will also feature its second Earth
                              Day event featuring a music festival as well.</p>

                              <p>"We are in a new era of energy innovation," said Daniel Yergin at a
                              Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) forum. Lithium-ion batteries are
                              providing electric storage solutions for electric cars such as the Chevrolet
                              Volt and the Dodge Circuit EV. Algae fuel is a new form of biofuel, but is still
                              under development.</p>

                              <p>"Energy Smackdown" was a competitive household activity which compared energy
                              usage between 60 separate households across three cities in or near Boston. The
                              various competitors came up with a variety of innovative methods to cut their
                              carbon footprint, installing solar electric panels, geothermal heat pumps, wind
                              turbines, and using a caulking gun to seal the home from drafts.</p>

                              <p>"In the average home, 75 percent of the electricity used to power home
                              electronics is consumed while the products are turned off." is a United States
                              Department of Energy (DOE) estimate.</p>

                              <p>Miami is installing a smart grid which will use individual household smart
                              meters to allow energy consumers know via a web site, their exact home energy
                              usage. "To me these are prudent and smart investments that will easily pay for
                              themselves. It will show the nation how to address environmental, energy, and
                              economic challenges all at the same time." said Miami mayor Manny Diaz.</p>

                              <p>Cal Dooley, CEO of the American Chemistry Council ACC, says the plastic bag
                              industry is prepared to spend US$50 million to revamp their manufacturing
                              facilities and will collect 470 million pounds of recycled plastic every year to
                              make plastic bags of 40% recycled content. The ACC is providing a donation to
                              the Keep America Beautiful environmental organisation, both of whom endorse this
                              new project. The Earth Day Network (EDN) and Natural Resources Defense Council
                              (NRDC) would like to see an end to the use of plastic bags, however. "We don't
                              want people to use disposable bags. We want people to use reusable bags," says
                              Darby Hoover of the NRDC.</p>

                              <p>Calgary researchers will begin field surveys to help save the "Northern
                              Leopard Frog (Rana Pipiens). "Northern Leopard Frogs are threatened in Alberta,
                              but endangered in British Columbia," said Dr. Des Smith, Primary Investigator
                              and Research Scientist with the Calgary Zoo's Centre for Conservation Research.
                              "It is essential to develop new monitoring techniques for Northern Leopard" said
                              Breana McKnight, Field Team Leader and Endangered Species Researcher.</p>

                              <p>The traditional Earth day ceremony of planting trees is garnering further
                              attention in Japan as Koichi Nakatani, the nation's Tree Planting Father travels
                              from Hokkaido to Okinawa.</p>

                              <p>Students can take part in an Earth Day photo contest sponsored by the
                              Institute for Global Environmental Strategies which will feature images and
                              scientific student research for the environmental change depicted in each photo
                              submitted.</p>

                              <p>“Earth Day should be about teaching about the environment every day,” said
                              Sean Mille director of education for EDN, “We emphasize taking action for your
                              classroom, school, district or community." 25,000 schools across America made
                              use of the environmental curriculum developed by the National Civic Education
                              Project, the Green Schools Campaign and the Educator’s Network. Lesson plans are
                              broad and varied and may focus on water pollution, recycling, composting, using
                              chemistry to convert cafeteria left-overs into biodiesel or ethanol fuel or
                              converting go-carts to operate on biodiesel or ethanol fuels in shop class.</p>

                              <p>"We aim to become carbon-neutral in a decade," he said.</p>

                              <p>"Climate Change threatens us all. Countries need to pull together to
                              de-carbonize the world economy. We know cutting greenhouse gas emissions is
                              possible and the Maldives is willing to play its part," Nasheed said, adding
                              that he hopes his plan will serve as a blueprint for other countries.</p>

                              <p>"We understand more than perhaps anyone what would happen to us if we didn't
                              do anything about it or if the rest of the world doesn't find the imagination to
                              confront this problem," Nasheed told Newshour in a telephone interview from the
                              Maldives' capital of Male.</p>

                              <p>"So basically, we don't want to sit around and blame others, but we want to
                              do whatever we can, and hopefully, if we can become carbon-neutral, and when we
                              come up with the plan, we hope that these plans also will serve as a blueprint
                              for other nations to follow. We think we can do it, we feel that everyone should
                              be engaged in it, and we don't think that this is an issue that should be taken
                              lightly."</p>

                              <p>Nasheed's plan calls for half of a square kilometre (0.19 square miles) of
                              solar panels and 155 wind turbines, each generating 1.5 megawatts. The
                              electricity will power vehicles as well. Boats and automobiles with gasoline
                              engines would be slowly replaced with electric versions. <br/>
                              Mohamed Nasheed, leader of the Maldives</p>

                              <p>The plan will cost an estimated US$1.1 billion. The economy of the Maldives,
                              reliant mainly on tourism and fishing, is worth $800 million a year.</p>

                              <p>Environmentalist Mark Lynas said that the plan could pay for itself in a
                              decade, due to savings on oil imports. "It's going to cost a lot of money but it
                              will also save a lot of money from not having to import oil," Lynas said.</p>

                              <p>"The point of doing it is that it is something the Maldives can lead the
                              world in. No rich country has the excuse that it is too expensive and we can't
                              do anything," Lynas said to the news agency Reuters.</p>

                              <p>"The Maldives could just give up. Its people could declare themselves climate
                              change refugees and ask for sanctuary elsewhere. But the new government is
                              taking a stand and asked us to give them a plan for a near zero-carbon economy,"
                              said Chris Goodall, the British climate change expert who led the development of
                              the carbon-neutral plan. "We don't want to pretend that this plan is going to be
                              easy to implement. There will be hiccups, and electricity supply will
                              occasionally be disrupted. But we think that building a near-zero-carbon
                              Maldives is a realistic challenge. Get it right and we will show the apathetic
                              developed world that action is possible, and at reasonable cost."</p>

                              <p>The Maldives are located in the Indian ocean and are among the lowest-lying
                              islands on the planet, with none of them rising more than six feet (1.8 metres)
                              above sea level, making them particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels
                              associated with global warming.</p>

                              <p>The city was designed by Foster and Partners, a British company.</p>

                              <p>“No one has ever built a zero-carbon city before. Nor one producing zero
                              waste or fully powered by renewable energy. Masdar City will accomplish all
                              three,” said Sultan Al Jaber.</p>

                              <p>The city will have a personal electrical power supply mainly from two
                              renewable energy sources: wind turbines and solar panels. Water will be provided
                              through a solar-powered desalination plant and air conditioning will be provided
                              naturally from wind towers.</p>

                              <p>It is planned to save more than $2 billion in oil over the next 25 years
                              along with creating more than 70 000 jobs.</p>

                              <p>The immense project will be supported by a company created for it called
                              'Masdar Initiative', which will develop and commercialise clean energy
                              technologies. It will also be supported by the WWF, a global conservation
                              charity, and it is hoped that international joint ventures will bring in more
                              money.</p>

                              <p>Some people fear that Masdar will become a domain for the luxury development

          hippogogreen:summary: The Solar Impulse, an experimental solar-powered airplane,
            landed in Switzerland on Thursday after completing a successful 26-hour
            test flight. The flight was a proof-of-concept displaying that a solar-powered
            aircraft can accumulate enough power from the sun during the day to power
            it through the night. The team that designed and built the aircraft believes
            that, in theory, the plane could fly indefinitely, given that there is
            enough sunlight to power it.

                              <p>The flight is the longest and highest flight by a piloted solar-powered
                              aircraft, with an average altitude of about 28,000 feet, and an average speed of
                              around 25 miles per hour. Pilot Andre Borschberg, a former fighter pilot in the
                              Swiss air force, said "I've been a pilot for forty years now, but this flight
                              has been the most incredible of my flying career. Just sitting there and
                              watching the battery charge level rise and rise thanks to the sun. I have just
                              flown more than 26 hours without using a drop of fuel and without causing any
                              pollution."</p>

                              <p>The plane can carry only one passenger, and contains 12,000 solar cells.
                              However, the plane does have its setbacks; a blog on the project's website
                              reported after seventeen hours of flight that "Andre's feeling great up there.
                              His only complaints involve little things like a slightly sore back as well as a
                              ten-hour period during which it was minus twenty degrees Celsius in the cockpit.
                              That made his drinking water system freeze up and worst of all his iPod
                              batteries die."</p>

                              <p>The project's intention is to show that emissions-free air travel is a
                              feasible concept; however, the team does not believe that current propulsion
                              methods will be replaced by alternatives in the near future.</p>

                              <p>The contest is known as the Eddie Aikau competition, named after a noted
                              Hawaiian surfer who was lost at sea during the 1970s. It has only taken place
                              eight times in the past 25 years. Tens of thousands of spectators from across
                              the state gathered to watch 28 expert surfers tackle the 40-foot waves.
                              Competitor Jamie O'Brien said, "We were all stoked out there, smiling, laughing
                              and having a good time." He added, "This is like a natural arena out here for
                              this and it's amazing to be a part of it." The monstrous waves were caused by
                              two cyclones to the northwest of the islands. Conditions have to be nearly
                              perfect for the competition to commence. The winner was 24 year-old Greg Long, a
                              first-time entrant who took home a $55,000 prize. The dangerous conditions
                              inflicted one injury, but safety teams were on standby to deal with any
                              accidents.</p>

            to be the first person to swim the entire length of the world's most dangerous
            river, the mighty Amazon. Martin is an endurance swimmer from Slovenia,
            who swims rivers - the Mississippi, the Danube and the Yangtze to date
            - to highlight their pollution to the world. Martin is also a rather overweight,
            horseburger loving Slovenian in his fifties who drinks two bottles of
            red wine a day... even when swimming.

                              <p>This is what some critics have to say:</p>

                              <p>Followers of Maringouin's impressive, disturbing feature debut, "Running
                              Stumbled," may not spot the filmmaker's touch in the brightly amusing first 30
                              minutes, but gradually, as the 52-year-old Martin ventures deep downstream and
                              flirts with his physical limits, the disorienting strangeness of "Running" seeps
                              into "Big River Man," resulting in something much darker than a merely amusing
                              promo reel for the Slovenian swimmer.</p>

                              <p><strong>- Robert Koehler, Variety</strong></p>

                              <p>People don't get much more documentary-worthy than Martin Strel... film-maker
                              John Maringouin could hardly fail to come up with a good story. In the event, he
                              got an absolute epic, in which Strel loses his marbles and insists on keeping
                              swimming despite severe risks to his physical health.</p>

                              <p>Director John Maringouin has chanced upon documentary gold - Strel is the
                              sort of off-kilter character even the most imaginative fiction writer would have
                              had trouble dreaming up.</p>

                              <a title="Road racing" href="/wiki/Road_racing">road racing</a>, club cyclists
                              used a fixed wheel bicycle for training during the winter months, generally
                              using a relatively low gear ratio, believed to help develop a good pedaling
                              style.<sup>[</sup>n the UK until the 1950s it was common for riders to use a
                              fixed wheel for time trials. The fixed wheel was also commonly used, and
                              continues to be used in the end of season hill climb races in the autumn. A
                              typical clubmen's fixed wheel machine would have been a "road-path" or
                              "road/track" cycle. In the era when most riders only had one cycle, the same
                              bike when stripped down and fitted with racing wheels was used for road time
                              trials and track racing, and when fitted with mudguards (fenders) and a bag it
                              was used for club runs, touring and winter training. By the 1960s,

                              derailleurs</a> had become the norm and riding fixed wheel on the road declined
                              over the next few decades. Recent years have seen renewed interest and increased
                              popularity of fixed wheel cycling.</p>

                              bicycles have achieved tremendous popularity, with the rise of discernible
                              regional aesthetic preferences for finish and design details. The rise in
                              popularity of fixed-gear bicycles in the mid-2000s, complete with adaptations
                              such as <a title="Spoke cards" href="/wiki/Spoke_cards">spoke cards</a>, is
                              attributed to bicycle messengers. Dedicated fixed-gear road bicycles are being
                              produced in greater numbers by established bicycle manufacturers. They are
                              generally low in price, and characterized by a very forgiving, slack

                              <body>

                              <p>I've been spending a lot of time recently thinking about lighting, because
                              I'm
                              <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?EAN=9780071630160&amp;lkid=J15656933&amp;pubid=K125307&amp;byo=1">writing
                              a book about green lighting</a>, which will be out this fall. I've been busy
                              approving layouts. Green lighting is a very exciting set of technologies,
                              because it provides some of the quickest paybacks of any energy efficiency
                              upgrades, it is easy to do, and it can improve productivity and comfort.</p>

                              <p>There's been a lot of excitement about LEDs (light emitting diodes) recently,
                              and some hot new bulbs are due from major manufacturers in the near future. They
                              are roughly 90% more energy efficient than regular old incandescents, they last
                              for tens of thousands of hours, and they produce less waste heat, meaning they
                              don't contribute to summer cooling loads. LEDs also can come in many colors, and
                              they can be rapidly switched. In fact, chances are good that you are looking at
                              them right now, since many serve as backlighting in computer displays.</p>

                              <p>LEDs are awesome, and their prices are dropping, though right now CFLs and
                              other fluorescents are a better buy for most homeowners who don't have
                              super-heavy lighting needs. Yes these bulbs have some mercury in them, but that
                              is dropping, and there are
                              <a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/eco-friendly/cfl-mercury-safety-460124">precautions
                              you can take, and do be sure to dispose of them properly</a>. However, also
                              don't panic. There is much more mercury in other common products (thermostats,
                              thermometers, electronics, switches), and I interviewed experts in the book who
                              calculated that you'd receive more exposure from eating a seafood meal than is
                              likely from a broken CFL.</p>

                              <p> In his weekly radio and Web address, Obama coupled his announcement with an
                              acknowledgment that efforts to recover from the recession are slow a day after
                              the Labor Department reported that private hiring in June rose by 83,000.</p>

                              <p>"It's going to take months, even years, to dig our way out, and it's going to
                              require an all-hands-on-deck effort," he said.</p>

                              <p>All told, 5,000 jobs are expected to be created through use of $1.85 billion
                              in money taken from the $787 billion economic stimulus that Obama pushed through
                              the U.S. Congress in early 2009 over the strenuous objections of Republicans.

                              generation plants in the world near Gila Bend, Ariz.</p>

                              <p>Abengoa Solar, headquartered in Lakewood, Colo., is a unit of Spanish

                              construction will create some 1,600 jobs in Arizona.</p>

                              it's good news that we've attracted a company to our shores to build a plant and
                              create jobs right here in America," Obama said.</p>

                              <p>Obama said $400 million in loan guarantees will be awarded to Colorado-based
                              Abound Solar Manufacturing to manufacture advanced solar panels at two new
                              plants, creating more than 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs.
                              </p>

                              <p> <strong>Plant in empty <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/car-tech/">car</a>

                              A Colorado plant is already being constructed and an Indiana plant will be built
                              in what is now an empty Chrysler factory.</p>

                              <p>The announcement addresses Obama's desire to create jobs related to green
                              technologies.</p>

                              <p>Obama, whose Democrats are anticipating losses in Nov. 2 congressional
                              elections because of the weak jobs picture, said the steps he is taking "won't
                              replace all the jobs we've lost overnight" and that "I know folks are
                              struggling."</p>

                              <p>He accused Republicans of blocking a $33 billion extension of unemployment
                              benefits that failed to pass the House of Representatives on Tuesday.</p>

                              <p>"At a time when millions of Americans feel a deep sense of urgency in their
                              own lives, Republican leaders in Washington just don't get it," Obama said.</p>

                              <p>Republicans say the problem is Democrats want to pass legislation that would
                              add to the country's debt.</p>

                              <p>In the Republican response to Obama's address, Senator Saxby Chambliss called
                              the country's $13 trillion debt "one of the most dangerous threats confronting
                              America today."</p>

                              <p>"At a time when many Americans are clipping coupons and pinching pennies,
                              President Obama and the Democrats in Congress continue to spend money that
                              they--we--do not have," Chambliss said.</p>

                              <p> </p>

                              <p> While the new technology has been touted as a solution toward moving the
                              United States away from its dependence on fossil fuels, it has so far stumbled
                              because of the high price tag for the massive plants.</p>

                              <p>A solar thermal plant, like this 200-megawatt Abengoa facility in Spain, uses
                              a vast array of mirrors to concentrate the sun's rays.</p>

                              <p>Traditional photovoltaic modules made by companies like
                              <a title="First Solar to acquire NextLight for $245 million -- Wednesday, Apr 28, 2010" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20003635-54.html">First
                              Solar</a> and Suntech directly convert sunlight into electricity, and make up
                              the largest chunk of the solar market.</p>

                              <p>Backers of solar thermal have said it would claim the lion's share of
                              large-scale projects in the United States, but a sharp drop in photovoltaic
                              panel prices has drawn much of the market's interest to that technology.</p>

                              <p>"With panel prices coming down so much for solar PV, solar thermal does not
                              look as cost-competitive anymore," Wedbush analyst Christine Hersey said.</p>

                              <p>Solar thermal is economical only on a large scale, lifting total project
                              costs into hundreds of millions of dollars, while PV systems can be built
                              piecemeal in smaller steps that are easier to finance.</p>

                              <p>"It does not make sense to do a [thermal] plant that is less than 100
                              megawatt," Cowen &amp; Co. analyst Rob Stone said. "That is because of the cost
                              of the steam plant that goes with it."</p>

                              <p>PV, however, can be used for a wide range of applications, from very large to
                              very small.</p>

                              <p>"In terms of ubiquity, PV is ultimately going to be the most widely deployed
                              technology just because it's going to show up ranging in size from 500MW
                              projects all the way down to solar cells on the roof of a hybrid vehicle," Stone
                              said.</p>

                              <p>One megawatt (1 million watts) is enough to power about 800 U.S. homes.</p>

                              <p> <strong>Federal support</strong> <br/>
                              The International Energy Agency predicts that several hundred gigawatts of solar
                              thermal power will be built by the middle of the century. (A gigawatt is 1
                              billion watts.)</p>

                              <p>Spain is currently the global leader in thermal solar development, with
                              hundreds of megawatts slated for construction.</p>

                              <p>China is likely to move quickly into the field and is expected to launch a
                              tender for project in the coming weeks, and a European consortium has announced
                              plans to build a massive project in the Sahara Desert.</p>

                              <p>

                              <p>In a solar thermal facility, mirrors on the ground direct sunlight to a tower
                              in order to generate steam energy.</p>

                              <p>The U.S. utility market for solar is also expected to grow sharply over the
                              next few years, but that will be possible only with government support, which
                              solar thermal companies have been lobbying for.</p>

                              <p>BrightSource recently won $1.37 billion in federal loan guarantees, while
                              Abengoa got $1.85 billion in conditional loan guarantees.</p>

                              <p>"The loan to Solana [a 280-megawatt plant in Arizona] is really an investment
                              in America's environmental future because that loan will be repaid," Fred Morse,
                              a senior adviser to Abengoa, said on a recent conference call.</p>

                              <p>Morse said those government guarantees were crucial to move the nearly 30
                              thermal solar projects sought by companies into operation.</p>

                              <p>"Billion-dollar projects cannot be financed today by commercial banks," he
                              said.</p>

                              <p>With investment hard to come by, solar thermal technology has been losing
                              ground.</p>

                              <p>"PV has been increasing and solar thermal has been dipping, as a percentage
                              of the projects being bid, in the last couple of years," Cowen's Stone said.
                              </p>

                              <p> <strong>Environmental concerns</strong> <br/>
                              Even as the technology grapples with high costs and financing worries, there are
                              other concerns as well. To make steam, solar thermal technology uses a lot of
                              water, which can cause problems in areas where the resource is scarce.</p>

                              <p>"A lot of times, you are putting these solar thermal units in the middle of
                              deserts where water is already a rare commodity," Simmons &amp; Co. analyst Burt
                              Chao said.</p>

                              <p>BrightSource, for instance, is using its federal loan guarantee for three
                              utility-scale solar thermal plants in the Mojave Desert in southeastern
                              California.</p>

                              <p>"For technologies where they want to use water, trying to get a project like
                              that approved in the Mojave Desert can be very, very difficult," Wedbush analyst
                              Hersey said. </p>

                              <p>The G8 agreed to a target to cut emissions by 80% by 2050, though interim
                              targets were not defined.</p>

                              <p>"I believe we've made some important strides forward as we move towards
                              Copenhagen," said United States President Barack Obama. "I don't think I have to
                              emphasise that climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time. The
                              science is clear and conclusive and the impacts can no longer be ignored."</p>

                              <p>Obama was referring to the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009,
                              scheduled for December 2009 in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

                              <p>"I hope tomorrow when we meet other countries we'll follow that through and
                              this is a very significant development, the first time it's ever been done,"
                              United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown said.</p>

                              <p>"The commitments expressed today at the G8 and Major Economies Forum (MEF)
                              leaders' meeting, while welcome, are not sufficient,"Ban Ki-moon, the
                              Secretary-General of the United Nations, said.</p>

                              <p>"For us the 80 percent figure is unacceptable and likely unattainable," said
                              Arkady Dvorkovich, the top economic aide to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.
                              "We won't sacrifice economic growth for the sake of emission reduction."</p>

            the Auriga Leader has docked in North America for the first time. Toyota
            Motor Corp will employ this car carrier for automobile shipments to Europe
            and North America from Japan. The vessel will be operated by the Japanese-based
            NYK Line.

                              <p>Auriga Leader has 328 solar panels to provide 40 kilowatts, about 10% of the
                              ship's power while sitting idling in dock. This amount of energy is the
                              equivalent to the power used by ten average homes.</p>

                              <p>"This is the first ship to direct the solar power into the ship's main
                              electrical grid. It's helping all of the time, and its helping with everything,
                              like the ship's thrusters and the hydraulics for the steering gear," said Brian
                              Mason, national manager of marine logistics and export for Toyota. <br/>

                              <p>The panels are installed on the ship’s car-carrier, and then connected to the
                              onboard 440 volt electrical network. Nippon Yusen K.K. and Nippon Oil Corp
                              created the Auriga Leader's US$ 1.6 million innovative green technology solar
                              power grid. The cargo ship has a length of 200 meters (656 ft) and gross tonnage
                              of 60,000 GT, which is capable of carrying 6,400 automobiles. <br/>

                              <p>Richard Steinke, executive director of the Port of Long Beach said of the
                              joint demonstration project, "From our standpoint, it's another positive step,"
                              to reduce diesel emissions and the release of greenhouse gas.</p>

                              countries</a> should pay to address the problem, and costs could top $50 billion
                              a year.</p>

                              <p>Climate Change, which many scientists believe is fuelled by human activities,
                              alters rain cycles and causes increased droughts and flooding. Rising
                              temperatures mean some traditional crops do not grow as well as they used to.
                              The United Nations predicts that in some
                              <a title="Africa" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Africa">African</a>
                              countries, crop yields could fall by half.</p>

                              <p>Oxfam researcher Kate Raworth says coping with these issues will be
                              expensive.</p>

                              <p>"Oxfam has estimated that for all developing countries to adapt to climate
                              change will cost at least $50 billion a year," she said. "And for that to be
                              done with justice we believe that the rich and the most polluting countries
                              should pay the vast share of the money to make possible for those countries most
                              vulnerable and least responsible for causing the problem to cope with the new
                              realities they have to deal with."</p>

                              <p>The report released by Oxfam at the conference on Tuesday says some countries
                              are already feeling the effects of a warming planet. In
                              <a title="South Africa" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/South_Africa">South
                              Africa</a>, farmers are planting faster-maturing crops to adapt to unpredictable
                              rainfall.</p>

                              <p>
                              <a title="Bangladesh" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Bangladesh">Bangladeshis</a>
                              are creating floating vegetable gardens that can thrive in spite of floods. But
                              Mozaharul Alam, who heads Bangladesh's climate adaptation effort, says overall
                              improvements to the food system still leave many families vulnerable.</p>

                              <p>"Most of the agriculture is subsistent in nature," said Alam. "So if [there
                              is] any failure of the crop on the ground, even if there is food available in
                              the market, unless the people has the buying capacity, that availability of the
                              food in the market has no meaning to the vulnerable family."</p>

                              <p>Oxfam argues the
                              <a title="United States" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United
                              States</a>, the

                              should be among the major sources of funds to help developing countries solve
                              their climate change problems.</p>

                              <p>These countries have agreed in principle, but one task of the Bali Conference
                              is to find out how much individual countries are willing to spend on
                              climate-related issues. It also aims to begin deciding how to divide those
                              resources between prevention of further climate change, and adaptation to the
                              changes that are already taking place.</p>

                              <p>The conference involves thousands of scientists, government officials and
                              development group representatives, and runs for another 10 days.</p>

                              Subsequent inquiries rejected allegations that climate scientists had colluded
                              to withhold scientific information, interfered with the peer-review process to
                              prevent dissenting scientific papers from being published, deleted raw data, or
                              manipulated data to make the case for global warming appear stronger than it is,
                              but the UEA was criticised for a "culture of withholding
                              information."<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy#cite_note-Randerson2017-03-31-6">[7]</a></sup>

                              which were concluded by the end of March 2010, with the remaining review
                              releasing its findings on 7

                              Although the CRU's use of statistics was generally commended, some of their
                              methods may not have been the best for the

                              The reports concluded that Phil Jones had no case to

                              The CRU's detractors were also criticised, with one of the reports deploring the
                              tone of their criticism and finding that some of the criticism had been
                              "selective and

                              was "unhelpfulness in responding to requests" and that "e-mails might have been

                              methods may not have been the best for the
                              purpose.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy#cite_note-SAP-Report-9">[10]</a></sup>
                              The reports concluded that Phil Jones had no case to
                              answer<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy#cite_note-Randerson2010-03-31-6">[7]</a></sup>
                              and that better statistical methods might not have produced significantly

                              The CRU's detractors were also criticised, with one of the reports deploring the
                              tone of their criticism and finding that some of the criticism had been
                              "selective and
                              uncharitable".<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy#cite_note-SAP-Report-9">[10]</a></sup>

                              was "unhelpfulness in responding to requests" and that "e-mails might have been

          hippogogreen:summary: "The Copenhagen Accord[1] is a document that delegates\
            \ at the 15th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 15) to the United\
            \ Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change agreed to \"take note\
            \ of\" at the final plenary on 18 December 2009.\n\n              The\
            \ Accord, drafted by, on the one hand, the United States and on the other,\
            \ in a united position as the BASIC countries, China, India, South Africa\
            \ and Brazil, is not legally binding and does not commit countries to\
            \ agree to a binding successor to the Kyoto Protocol, whose present round\
            \ ends in 2012.[2] The BBC immediately reported that the status and legal\
            \ implications of the Copenhagen Accord were unclear.[3] Tony Tujan of\
            \ the IBON Foundation suggests the failure of Copenhagen\n           \
            \   may prove useful, if it allows us to unravel some of the underlying\
            \ misconceptions and work towards a new, more holistic view of things.[4]\
            \ This could help gain the support of developing countries. Lumumba Stansilaus\
            \ Di-Aping, UN Ambassador from Sudan, has indicated that, in its current\
            \ form, the Accord \"is not sufficient to move forward on\", and that\
            \ a new architecture is needed which is just and equitable. [5]\n    \

                              and emphasises a "strong political will to urgently combat climate change in

                              concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous
                              anthropogenic interference with the climate

                              </p>

                              <p>The objective of the Kyoto climate change conference was to establish a
                              legally binding international agreement, whereby all the participating nations
                              commit themselves to tackling the issue of global warming and greenhouse gas
                              emissions. The target agreed upon was an average reduction of 5.2% from 1990
                              levels by the year 2012. According to the treaty, in 2012, Annex I countries
                              must have fulfilled their obligations of reduction of greenhouse gases emissions
                              established for the first commitment period (2008–2012) (see Annex B of the
                              Protocol).</p>

                              <p>The five principal concepts of the Kyoto Protocol

                              <li>Commitments. The heart of the Protocol lies in establishing commitments for
                              the reduction of greenhouse gases that are legally binding for Annex I
                              countries, as well as general commitments for all member countries.</li>
                              <li>Implementation. In order to meet the objectives of the Protocol, Annex I
                              countries are required to prepare policies and measures for the reduction of
                              greenhouse gases in their respective countries. In addition, they are required
                              to increase the absorption of these gases and utilize all mechanisms available,
                              such as joint implementation, the clean development mechanism and emissions
                              trading, in order to be rewarded with credits that would allow more greenhouse
                              gas emissions at home.</li>

                              Witoelar</a> of Indonesia told reporters that a detailed proposal is not
                              necessary at this stage, but participation by all nations is vital.</p>

                              <p>"We will be happy if this Bali road map is general so we will not push for a
                              very detailed in this short time," he said. "The introduction, the process is
                              important."</p>

                              <p>As the conference opened,
                              <a title="Australia" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>'s
                              new prime minister,

                              gas</a> emissions. That act earned a standing ovation in Bali, and focused
                              attention on the failure of the
                              <a title="United States" href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States">United
                              States</a> to sign the protocol - the only developed nation not to have done so.
                              </p>

                              <p>"While the current U.S. delegation will not join in serious negotiations over
                              mandatory limits on global warming pollution, they won't be around when the
                              final deal is made in 2009. A new team will be on the field with a very
                              different game plan," he said. "The other nations must not allow the U.S. to
                              derail, delay or water down the Bali mandate."</p>

                              <p>Senior U.S. negotiator

                              Watson</a> denied his country was blocking progress, saying the U.S. had merely
                              chosen a different course.</p>

                              <p>"It's up to each country to do the analysis and analyze for themselves if the
                              target is do-able. Obviously the U.S. came to a different conclusion," he said.
                              "We respect the decisions other countries have made and of course ask them to
                              respect the decision that we've made."</p>

                              among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases.</p>

                              <p>Other subjects on the agenda in Bali include saving the world's remaining
                              forests, and sharing technologies to help developing nations grow in

                              affected by global warming to cope with the impacts. The money could go toward
                              flood-proof houses, better water management, and crop diversification.</p>

                              <p>The Bali conference will continue until December 14. Thousands of government

                              <p>"The probability of deploying hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles in the next 10 to
                              20 years is low." said Tom Welch of the U.S. Department of Energy. "We asked
                              ourselves, 'Is it likely in the next 10 or 15, 20 years that we will convert to
                              a hydrogen car economy?' The answer, we felt, was 'no,'" said Chu.</p>

                              <p>In response, the U.S. Fuel Cell Council and the National Hydrogen Association
                              said, “The cuts proposed in the DOE hydrogen and fuel-cell program threaten to
                              disrupt commercialization of a family of technologies that are showing
                              exceptional promise and beginning to gain market traction. Fuel-cell vehicles
                              are not a science experiment. These are real vehicles with real marketability
                              and real benefits. Hundreds of fuel-cell vehicles have collectively logged
                              millions of miles.”</p>

                              <p>“I just got the Clarity, which is a wonderful hydrogen vehicle,” said
                              Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. He lent his car to The Hydrogen Road Tour.</p>

                              <p>On Tuesday, The Hydrogen Road Tour began in Chula Vista, California. Twelve
                              hydrogen fuel cell cars by seven auto makers will arrive in Vancouver, British
                              Columbia June 3 for the Hydrogen + Fuel Cells 2009 conference, a global hydrogen
                              and fuel cell event. "The point really is to raise awareness about fuel celled
                              vehicles and hydrogen, their benefits both to energy efficiency and the
                              environment as well as to consumers because we really believe these vehicles are
                              going to be a market winner," said Catherine Dunwoody, the Executive Director of
                              the California Fuel Cell Partnership.</p>

                              <p>The Hydrogen Fuel Cells 2009 conference began June 1. "Our global
                              environmental challenges, such as climate change, do not stop at the border," "
                              said John Tak, conference Chair, "I am pleased that scientists, engineers,
                              government representatives and businesspeople from more than 35 countries are
                              coming to Vancouver, an active hub for hydrogen and fuel cell development, to
                              help create solutions to these challenges."</p>

                              <p>The Ohio Fuel Cell Symposium was held in North Canton, Ohio on Wednesday and
                              Thursday. "The hydrogen and fuel cell categories are at a stage where they have
                              the momentum and energy to accomplish some truly revolutionary things in terms
                              of how they apply their technologies," said William Whittenberger, president of
                              Catacel Corp. These fuel cells produce electricity and exhaust carbon dioxide
                              and water.</p>

                              <p>A hydrogen powered municipal street cleaning vehicle is currently being
                              tested for the next year and half in Basel, Switzerland. "Our aim is to take
                              fuel cell technology from the laboratory onto the street," said Empa's Internal
                              Combustion Engines Laboratory Project Leader Christian Bach.</p>

                              <p>Dan Lutz, the fleet manager for the Beloit, Wisconsin public works
                              department, experimented with retro-fitting his personal truck. The department
                              now has a large pickup truck, a garbage truck, a recycling truck, a police squad
                              car and a small pickup truck using hydrogen technology increasing gas mileage
                              from 14 to 22 and 31 mpg. "We know the basic technology works, but the issue is,
                              is it practical," said City Manager Larry Arft, "Can it be used realistically?"
                              </p>

                              <p>The drawback is that the technology may rely on platinum, a rare metal, or
                              palladium. Infrastructure would need to be changed to supply hydrogen fueling
                              stations. Critics are also concerned about hydrogen fuel storage and the costs
                              of retro-fitting existing vehicles.</p>

                              <p>The heads of Asean Power Utilities/Authorities (Hapua) Council got together
                              in Manila this week and are forming an ASEAN Power Grid.</p>

                              <p>Energy ministers and delegates from ASEAN member countries, Brunei, Cambodia,
                              Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and the
                              Philippines are pursuing alternative sources of energy and connecting the power
                              grids of the member countries.</p>

                              <p>A task force was created by the Philippines Department of Energy that will
                              look into the possibility of using nuclear power as a counter-measure to
                              dependence on oil to power up the Philippines and the rest of ASEAN's power
                              generators.</p>

                              <p>Energy secretary Angelo Reyes also received the recommendations from a
                              six-man team from the International Atomic Energy Agency on the prospects of
                              operating the moth-balled Bataan Nuclear Power Plant.</p>

                              <p>The Bataan nuclear plant was first built in the late seventies under the
                              administration of President Ferdinand Marcos but was scrapped by President
                              Corazon Aquino in 1986 owing to kick-backs in the plant's construction and
                              safety concerns.</p>

                              <p>Reyes stated that the council and the department was also looking into
                              alternative sources of renewal energy such as solar and wind power, biomass,
                              geothermal and hydro-electric to reduce dependency on fossil fuel.</p>

                              <p>For the time, the Philippines has implemented several measures on conserving
                              energy particularly the conversion to compact fluorescent lights (CFLs).</p>

                              <p>Swiss adventurer Bertrand Piccard, the initiator of the project, pilot André
                              Borschberg, and the host of designers and developers who made the flight
                              possible may have entered the history books, but what does their achievement
                              mean in practical terms?</p>

                              <p>“I hope that in two years time at the next Green Aviation Show we shall be
                              able to give a prize to the hero of the day, Bertrand Piccard,” Gerard Feldzer,
                              director of the Air and Space Museum at Paris’ Le Bourget airport, told
                              swissinfo.ch</p>

                              <p>Feldzer, who has known Piccard for many years, is an expert on
                              environmentally-friendly aircraft. He points out though that Solar Impulse is
                              not the first plane of its type.</p>

                              <p>The Green Aviation Show awarded for example its 2010 prize to Eric Raymond –
                              who first crossed the United States in <br/>
                              a solar-powered plane 20 years ago.</p>

                              <p>The difference was that Raymond made his flight in one-hour hops, Feldzer
                              explained.</p>
                              <h3>Twice the size, ten times the problems </h3>
                              <p>“The technique is no different, but Piccard’s achievement is to build a big
                              enough plane. When you double the size, that doesn’t mean you have twice the
                              number of problems. You have ten times the problems.”</p>

                              <p>On the one hand the structural challenge is much more complex – supporting
                              the giant wing, and transmitting and storing the energy, for example.</p>

                              <p>But a long flight is a human challenge too.</p>

                              <p>“You have to be able sit still, take tiny snatches of sleep… It’s like a
                              space flight, or even worse. You can’t move… Everything has to be within reach.”
                              </p>

                              <p>It would have been possible to fly a solar-powered drone across the Atlantic
                              long ago, Feldzer explained; having a person on board “changes everything”.</p>
                              <h3>Aircraft of the future </h3>
                              <p>Nevertheless, great as the achievement is, there will never be solar-powered
                              transport planes, which are far too heavy, he said.</p>

                              <p>That doesn’t mean solar panels have no role to play in the aircraft of the
                              future.</p>

                              <p>They might be embedded in the metal of the wings or fuselage to help reduce
                              electricity consumption, particularly when the plane is on the ground, Feldzer
                              believes. They could then power the air conditioning, or help at take-off.</p>

                              <p>For Feldzer the green fuel of the future for transport planes is hydrogen.
                              </p>

                              <p>But for smaller planes he says the future is electric. Light electric
                              aircraft are already being built, notably by the Chinese, for use in training or
                              for air clubs, where the planes are airborne for only about 45 minutes.</p>

                              <p>You could fit the hangar with solar panels and use the power to charge one
                              battery while the plane was using another, and then swap them round, he says.

                              <h3>Demonstration </h3>
                              <p>Anil Sethi, the founder and CEO of the start-up Flisom, a spin-off of the
                              Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, sees the achievement of Solar Impulse
                              through the eyes of a specialist in cell technology.</p>

                              <p>“Solar cells have been around for about 50 years now, but they’ve been
                              expensive and heavy,” he told swissinfo.ch.</p>

                              <p>“What Solar Impulse is doing is to demonstrate that this clean energy can
                              make a difference, and it is possible.”</p>

                              <p>He agrees with Feldzer that solar-powered transport planes are not on the
                              cards, but he sees an exciting future for clean photovoltaic energy.</p>

                              <p>“In our lifetime it is safe to say that we won’t get from Switzerland to the
                              US with planes powered entirely by solar energy… but we may spin off a
                              recreational activity. You might have planes that fly lower and go at a slower
                              speed, but it’s a cleaner way to travel from Zurich to Bern, for example.”</p>
                              <h3>Credibility </h3>
                              <p>Photovoltaic energy “is coming of age”, Sethi believes. He thinks that in two
                              or three years time people will be able to buy photovoltaic energy at the same
                              cost they pay for power from the grid.</p>

                              <p>Solar energy will be used for providing power to homes, and for so-called
                              “mobile” technology: phones and laptops, which are currently not really mobile
                              at all, says Sethi, since they need frequent recharging.</p>

                              <p>As for cars, it could be used for topping up the batteries in electric
                              vehicles, and for keeping the interiors cool in hot climates by circulating the
                              air.</p>

                              <p>For Sethi, Solar Impulse has given this type of energy credibility: “People
                              no longer believe it is just a fad.”</p>

                              <p>This can only be good news for his own company, which wants to see it used in
                              a whole range of applications.</p>

                              <p>“Rather than make human beings fly, I believe the vision is to make our
                              imagination fly,” he said.</p>

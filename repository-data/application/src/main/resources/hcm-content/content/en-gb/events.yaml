              \ /> Higher education institutions and their communities often deal\
              \ with similar sustainability challenges and opportunities, but how\
              \ can they work more closely together? &nbsp;In light of limited funding\
              \ and municipal government constraints, can co-operative projects and\
              \ programs have a synergistic effect?&nbsp; Community-wide planning\
              \ is especially important when developing strategies for adaptation\
              \ and reducing vulnerability.&nbsp; How well is your college or university\
              \ preparing students &ndash; through curricular and extracurricular\
              \ activities &ndash; for the sustainability challenges they will face\
              \ during their lifetimes?&nbsp; Workshops and presentations in this\
              \ track should discuss how to broaden the impact of campus learning\
              \ and establish connections to local governments, primary and secondary\
              \ schools, businesses, and community groups.&nbsp; Proposals should\
              \ include challenges and successes from innovative community-campus\
              \ partnerships.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<br /> Resources:&nbsp;\n<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10755-010-9155-7\"\

              \ \n<p><strong>2. Change Management: Towards Transformation</strong>&nbsp;\n\
              <br /> So, you&rsquo;ve established a sustainability program on your\
              \ campus. &nbsp;But how do you then integrate sustainability into your\
              \ organizational culture, identity, governance, and decision making,\
              \ thereby transforming the institution?&nbsp; We are looking for submissions\
              \ that tackle consensus-building with stakeholders and finding collaborative\
              \ ways of mitigating and managing sustainability and risk.&nbsp; Submissions\
              \ in this track should include an examination of your process rather\
              \ than your content.&nbsp; How did you engage senior leadership?&nbsp;\
              \ What path did you take in strategic, sustainability, or climate action\
              \ planning or goal setting?&nbsp; How did you overcome change resistors\
              \ and/or obstacles? How did you apply a systems thinking approach in\
              \ the design and implementation of your plans, projects or partnerships?&nbsp;\
              \ What challenges did you face?&nbsp; Bumps in the road are often our\
              \ greatest teachers.&nbsp; Submissions to this track can also include\
              \ development or operation of behavior change, social norming or community-based\
              \ social marketing programs.\n<br /> Resources:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"\

              <br /> The social realm of sustainability is often our most vexing because\
              \ it can encompass a wide range of topics that are challenging to define\
              \ and measure.&nbsp; Yet it may be our most important because it is\
              \ the basis of a democratic society.&nbsp; How is your institution or\
              \ community building positive and inclusive campus climates in which\
              \ everyone can achieve their full potential?&nbsp; Proposals submitted\
              \ to this track should include challenges and successes in social justice\
              \ programming, purchasing practices and strategies for promoting individual,\
              \ community, and ecological health and wellness.&nbsp; Share your model\
              \ on finding the intersections between sustainability, diversity awareness,\
              \ and cultural competence.&nbsp;\n<br /> Resources:&nbsp;\n<a href=\"\

              \ \n<p><strong>4. The Built Environment</strong>&nbsp;\n<br /> How do\
              \ you improve campus and community well-being through the built environment?&nbsp;\
              \ It&rsquo;s not just about the buildings; it includes roads and trails,\
              \ parks and landscaping, transportation and food services. &nbsp;Planning\
              \ for the built environment impacts the natural environment and can\
              \ influence water quality, stormwater runoff, soil compaction, noise,\
              \ air quality, and more.&nbsp; How is your project inclusive of environmental\
              \ restoration, learning landscapes, alternative transportation, dining,\
              \ or utilities?&nbsp; Presentations and workshops within this track\
              \ will examine innovative projects from the master planning stage through\
              \ operations and maintenance.&nbsp; Proposals should include innovative\
              \ projects or processes that can be applied on other campuses.\n<br\

              >The Value of Green Infrastructure</a></p> \n<p><strong>5. The Campus\
              \ as a Learning Laboratory</strong>&nbsp;\n<br /> As the workplace and\
              \ industry continue to change to meet the demands and challenges of\
              \ the 21st century, we need to prepare our students to take on the world&rsquo;s\
              \ complex problems. The campus environment offers ripe opportunities\
              \ for researching and learning about full-spectrum sustainability, which\
              \ will equip students with the knowledge, skills, and expertise needed\
              \ for this new paradigm. How is your institution handling curriculum\
              \ and research integration for sustainability? What innovative pedagogy\
              \ lies at the nexus of academics and operations? How is sustainability\
              \ preparing students for success beyond campus? What pedagogical models\
              \ do you have to share which can be utilized by others in the community?\
              \ Submissions should include the process for implementation, parties\

              \ and measure.&nbsp; Yet it may be our most important because it is\

              \ the 21st century, we need to prepare our students to take on the world&rsquo;s\

                              research and development activities have increased significantly over the past
                              two years. The Department of Energy (DoE), the Department of Defense (DoD), the
                              National Science Foundation (NSF), and numerous state agencies have carefully
                              evaluated technologies and awarded funds (Resource Conservation and Recovery
                              Act) to promising technologies that may considerably contribute to an increase
                              in capacity, production, and distribution of renewable fuels.</p>

                              <p>Experts in the biofuels area have recognized that the science and engineering
                              foundation of the <em>next generation of biofuels</em> is based on application
                              of molecular biology as a way of optimizing feedstock/fuels generated by
                              microorganisms, development of novel extraction/reaction technologies, discovery
                              of new and robust catalysts for conversion of lignocellulose into
                              feedstocks/fuels, and novel strategies to manage feedstock/biofuel quality,
                              logistics, and integration into current fuel production/distribution
                              infrastructure. Some of the most promising biofuel technologies include algae
                              biodiesel/renewable diesel, extraction of energy from wastewater treatment
                              operations, and conversion of lignocellulose into fuels using thermochemical or
                              sugar fermentation platforms.</p>

                              <p>At the 2014 Mississippi State University Biofuels Conference, international
                              and national researchers and experts from industry and academia will discuss
                              their progress on the science and engineering fundamentals, and the challenges
                              with each of these technologies associated with scale-up, regulatory compliance,
                              negotiations with stakeholders, feedstock logistics, and fuel distribution.</p>

                              <p>The invited speakers will discuss the state of the <em>next generation of
                              biofuels</em> and progress toward commercialization. On the first day of the
                              conference, August 12, experts on biofuels will discuss the latest information
                              on (1) costs and availability of feedstocks, (2) strategies being developed by
                              states and industry to deliver feedstocks to biofuel facilities, (3) costs,
                              markets, and sustainability of algae and microbial oils, bio-oil, and
                              lignocellulosic ethanol and gasoline, (4) chain supply economics and strategies
                              for optimum locations of biofuel facilities, and (5) life-cycle analysis of
                              technologies. Attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with future
                              engineers and scientists developing new technologies for the <em>next generation
                              of biofuels</em> via student poster presentations/competition that evening. On
                              the second day, August 13, biofuels companies will discuss the challenges of
                              commercialization: (1) establishing new markets for biofuels, (2) transitioning
                              from bench to pilot scale, (3) meeting the required fuel standards, (4) impact
                              of future legislation on the market, and (5) economics.</p>

              <html> <body> <p>The purification
                              process of water may reduce the concentration of particulate matter including
                              suspended particles, parasites, bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi; and a range of
                              dissolved and particulate material derived from the surfaces that water may have
                              made contact with after falling as rain.</p> <p>The
                              standards for drinking water quality are typically set by governments or by
                              international standards. These standards will typically set minimum and maximum
                              concentrations of contaminants for the use that is to be made of the
                              water.</p> <p>It is not possible to tell whether water
                              is of an appropriate quality by visual examination. Simple procedures such as
                              boiling or the use of a household activated carbon filter are not sufficient for
                              treating all the possible contaminants that may be present in water from an unknown
                              source. Even natural spring water – considered safe for all practical purposes in
                              the 1800s – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is
                              needed. Chemical analysis, while expensive, is the only way to obtain the
                              information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of
                              purification.</p> </body>

                              nutrients are strictly limited to non-toxic, non-harmful synthetic materials that
                              have no negative effects on the natural environment; they can be used in continuous
                              cycles as the same product without losing their integrity or quality. In this manner
                              these materials can be used over and over again instead of being "downcycled" into
                              lesser products, ultimately becoming waste. Biological Nutrients are organic
                              materials that, once used, can be disposed of in any natural environment and
                              decompose into the soil, providing food for small life forms without affecting the
                              natural environment. This is dependent on the ecology of the region; for example,
                              organic material from one country or landmass may be harmful to the ecology of
                              another country or landmass.</p> </body>

                              research and development activities have increased significantly over the past
                              two years. The Department of Energy (DoE), the Department of Defense (DoD), the
                              National Science Foundation (NSF), and numerous state agencies have carefully

                              in capacity, production, and distribution of renewable fuels.</p>

                              <p>Experts in the biofuels area have recognized that the science and engineering
                              foundation of the <em>next generation of biofuels</em> is based on application
                              of molecular biology as a way of optimizing feedstock/fuels generated by
                              microorganisms, development of novel extraction/reaction technologies, discovery
                              of new and robust catalysts for conversion of lignocellulose into
                              feedstocks/fuels, and novel strategies to manage feedstock/biofuel quality,
                              logistics, and integration into current fuel production/distribution
                              infrastructure. Some of the most promising biofuel technologies include algae
                              biodiesel/renewable diesel, extraction of energy from wastewater treatment
                              operations, and conversion of lignocellulose into fuels using thermochemical or
                              sugar fermentation platforms.</p>

                              <p>At the 2014 Mississippi State University Biofuels Conference, international
                              and national researchers and experts from industry and academia will discuss
                              their progress on the science and engineering fundamentals, and the challenges
                              with each of these technologies associated with scale-up, regulatory compliance,
                              negotiations with stakeholders, feedstock logistics, and fuel distribution.</p>

                              <p>The invited speakers will discuss the state of the <em>next generation of
                              biofuels</em> and progress toward commercialization. On the first day of the
                              conference, August 12, experts on biofuels will discuss the latest information
                              on (1) costs and availability of feedstocks, (2) strategies being developed by
                              states and industry to deliver feedstocks to biofuel facilities, (3) costs,
                              markets, and sustainability of algae and microbial oils, bio-oil, and
                              lignocellulosic ethanol and gasoline, (4) chain supply economics and strategies
                              for optimum locations of biofuel facilities, and (5) life-cycle analysis of
                              technologies. Attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with future
                              engineers and scientists developing new technologies for the <em>next generation
                              of biofuels</em> via student poster presentations/competition that evening. On
                              the second day, August 13, biofuels companies will discuss the challenges of
                              commercialization: (1) establishing new markets for biofuels, (2) transitioning
                              from bench to pilot scale, (3) meeting the required fuel standards, (4) impact
                              of future legislation on the market, and (5) economics.</p>

                              <p>While new green events emerge every year, West Coast Green represents the
                              largest milestone yet in the green innovation movement. The West Coast Green
                              experience is a feast of innovations, ideas and opportunities designed to expand
                              your business, widen your vision, and stimulate your thinking with the latest
                              best practices and key players in building, business and design.</p>

                              <p>Each year the conference has grown to meet the needs of industry leaders,
                              practitioners and homeowners; this year the conversation will deepen to include
                              a focus on the <strong>intersection of the built environment</strong> and
                              technology. And, we're also including emerging products within the Cleantech
                              sector that have the greatest ability to reduce global warming such as solar,
                              wind and waste reduction.</p>

                              <p>At West Coast Green you’ll find over 300 exhibitors showcasing the latest in
                              resource-efficiency among a <strong>stunning array of green</strong> and healthy
                              building products. Over 100 experts and visionary leaders will be presenting
                              their latest developments, insights, and inspiration at the expanding frontiers
                              of the field. And over 11,000 attendees including the entire chain of
                              professionals and decision-makers rarely reached by other conferences are
                              expected.</p>

                              <p>We are not only setting records in scale and scope, we’re also
                              <strong>incorporating breakthroughs and innovations</strong> in conference
                              design, content, and learning design. That means you’re not going to collapse at
                              the end of the day with blisters and a headache. We’re pulling out all the stops
                              to make the experience of attending as gratifying and productive as possible.
